Cryptocurrency trading predictions and indicators.



## Team members

We will do comparisons to other assets classes such S&P 500, Apple and Gold.
We also compare to the top 20 cryptocurrency's.
Sentiment Anaylsis


## Tasks

1. Determine the signals we will use and document the formulas
RSI
Volume
Moving Average  - 200 day
Daily high and low.

2. 3 Machine Learning models to be used

3. Write Python algorithm

4. Present Data - Graphs, Panels, Resulting Data Outputs, etc.

## Our Aim
To create trading indicators and tools that will help us with out Bitcoin trading.

Method
We looked for relationships which could help us predict Bitcoin’s price.

Damien will present:
A comparison of Bitcoin (Cryptocurrency asset class) against more established asset classes
Commodities - Gold
Shares - S&P500
