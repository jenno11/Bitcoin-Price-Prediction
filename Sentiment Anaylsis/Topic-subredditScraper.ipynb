Not a terrible quote.But the main thing matter is what is the truth and what to destroy.I strongly believed the scaling debate ended up being a poison pill to make BTC a financial instrument which is friendly to banking system (Store of value that is sold as instruments by institutions) instead of a p2p digital money which can be utilized by a quickly digitized society (Cryptocurrency with potential for a circle economy which takes power away from institutions) \\n\\nThere is vitriol coming from a lot of btc maximalists who feel as if bch was an attack on bitcoin. Bank funding developers was an attack on bitcoin. Censorship of reddit and bitcoin talk was an attack on bitcoin. Using politics of round-tables vs miner voting by hashrate was an attack on bitcoin. \\n\\nSeeing mainstream acceptance of bitcoin is a bittersweet moment. It is nice seeing price go up, normies all knowing about it and institutions finally taking it seriously. But it is souring to see it being treated more as a replacement for stocks or bonds instead of a digital currency fundamentally has roots to the blocksize wars. \\n\\nMake Crypto Scary AgainWhat is the current size of the bitcoin cash blockchain vs bitcoin? Just curious, not trying to argue or anything.Agreed, as if the truth could destroy the bad thing then why not.Yeah.perfect quote for the blockchain wars going on.There is risk in everything!*Is like, not \"be like\".‚úçÔ∏èHave you ever run a node?Watching the mainstream acceptance of bitcoin is a bittersweet moment.Congratulations! You\\'ve been tipped for your post. u/chaintip - See who else has been tipped [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/rbtc-tipper/submitted/)You meaqn tether is the actual truth here, seriously, is it seems to be?And what makes you presume it that he is laying the security blanket.But the facts says something else about that brother! :)Market disagreed.This is the truth but I am still confused that what to destroy here.Bitcoin Gold is the real Bitcoin Cash.Being true will not help to survive in this world being fake is what people need the most to uprise.As a side note. I don\\'t hate layer 2 solutions. I think they are needed for better scaling in bitcoin. But I am very against the timing of limiting blocksize before the solution was mature enough to use.The blockchain itself, or just the blocks?BTC: 370 GB  https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/charts/blockchain-size\\n\\nBCH: 170GB  https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/blockchain-size (The sharp drop is fork date)And the size of risk matters the size of the victory, big risk gives huge victory.Risk is everything which we are fear off and everything which make us something.[sic]yeah I run a node***\\nu/KallistiOW, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2wkgpg8ycrwd2whlsspusawrjrxu2rw4hk6k) `0.00402604 BCH` | `~2.51 USD` by u/rbtc-tipper\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***Did you look at the picture...?\\n\\nNotice anything missing...?The market never stops considering though, so that can and will change.\\n\\nJust like how the market used to agree that Bitcoin was worth $1, then it changed its mind.[Market was manipulated.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qaie8t/debunking_the_btc_ticker_followed_the_hashrate/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\\n\\n\\nEdit: whoops wrong link, fixedThe market was never concerned with that questionI think you got downvoted because it\\'s a really tough truth for us to swallow. I dont think you are telling us what your personal choice is.Do you know where to is the market and where the destruction is?XDThe market also \"agrees\" that shiba Inu has valueIntentionally ambiguous post on shared BTC/BCH sub is intentionally ambiguous. ;)Tether is the true store of valueThings were a lot better for me when my reddit account was only two weeks old like you, give it a few years you will learn.I wish you will get what you want but this is not what you need.At least keeping the limit incentivized the development of such solutions.the blockchain itself.Thanks !For sure but there is always a maximum level of risk one can afford to accept!\\n\\nWe also need to determine if the potential rewards far exceed the risk in a given timeframe.Agreed but we should always risk what we can afford to risk!Do you run a bitcoin cash node?>  market never stops considering though\\n\\nBingo! ^^/u/chaintip\\n\\nAs evidenced that BCH is still here and functioning perfectly well with merely 1% of the hash power. For example, I love the new DAA algorith! **[This graph](https://fork.lol/reward/dari/btc) shows how BCH adapts quickly to any and all market price and mining conditions, persistently remaining ever so slightly more profitable than BTC**. This is a constant, nagging factor that exists in the market place that can\\'t be ignored no matter how big or small the miner. **As time erodes the block rewards, and the speculators show how fickle they really are (BTC market dominance has dropped to 45%), this BCH profitability gap will widen.**I hope it actually does, but unfortunately I don‚Äôt see that happening unless the entire market tanks and it‚Äôs only real crypto punks left in the space. Which is not what anyone wants.. I think bch should be aiming for new aths, not to replace Bitcoin cos it really is not going to happen.I wish we can witness these kinda things in the future, I won\\'t regret anything this time.Because Reddit banned bitcointalk?I certainly prefer the technology of BCH. However I‚Äôm a Monero community member, I know all about the market being irrational and unfair trust me. \\n\\nI really do hope the best for you guys, it just pains me to say I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen but plz do prove me wrong! Good luck everyone.I know, what a joke. Markets are irrationalUnderapreciated comment. ü§£The limits or not yet considered in the mindset but the consequences.Yes***\\nu/Shibinator, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2n0f4l4kmqd2sdhlzgz4pns5n74ycuuh8r84) `0.0008 BCH` | `~0.50 USD` by u/bitmeister\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***Thanks for the tip.Dream bigger.\\n\\nWe\\'re going to #1.\\n\\nNot just in the crypto market, but the world currency market.  Bigger than the USD, used by more people every day.lol. We don\\'t need crypto punks. Right now speculators outnumber users by at least 10 to 1. Price discovery is entirely based on ignorance where the vast majority of holders know nothing about the shortcomings and limitations of what they\\'re buying.Well, what happens when the biggest fool has bought BTC, there are no buyers left, and the fools ask themselves, now what do I do with this stuff?>  the entire market tanks \\n\\nIt\\'s not a zero-sum game. Both can exist and thrive. The market just isn\\'t interested in the economical version at this time, so we are seeing a speculator\\'s equilibrium, not a user equilibrium.\\n\\nThe BCH advantage doesn\\'t strive for ATH prices. When BCH is, or will be optimal, the price will be less volatile. The only reason the price of BCH should move is to compensate for the USD\\'s loss in value. Regarding your concerns, we are a long ways off from this point, but BCH is moving along nice and smooth in BTC\\'s wake.Lol at myself, that was the wrong link, fixedI\\'m technically a monero member as well, I just made a post in /rbtc a day or so ago asking for more info about the bitcoin fork and my eyes opened. My biggest investment has been into cpus, so im really indirectly invested in monero even if I held no coins. \\n\\nIm coming back after learning a lot and I know that people downvoted you for the wrong reasons. I didnt think your comment was because you lacked faith, just observing what you considered to be fact. Considering how emotional traders are at this point, market makers are playing every trick they have. Miners will win in the end.\\n\\nThe part where I\\'ve become convinced bch has something here, is how well chaintip works. It really does make crypto easy, which I dont need but I can see value in. There\\'s way more stupid people than smart people like us, so having an easy solution to crypto is what it\\'s gonna take. They dont want to know how it works, they just want to know when it works.Lolll one problem with that: it lacks fungibility :) cannot be an effective currency. That‚Äôs what Monero is.True words, exactly what I was about to write, thank you for that.I agree with your general sentiments however my comment on cryptopunks was in the scenario where the entire market collapses, and the only people left are the ones there for the tech. I think that is the only chance BCH has if ever ‚Äúflipping‚Äù Bitcoin in ANY meaningful way, cos while Bitcoin has a market cap greater than 7 figures it ain‚Äôt happening lolSame can be said for literally every investment vehicle ever conceived of by mankind.. also beyond, to Ponzi Schemes etc. What if we ran out of oxygen? What if all the water evaporated? What if BCH flips BTC? LolThe point we were discussing is ‚Äúbch flipping btc‚Äù so your comment was kinda needless, my comment still stands correct, the only way that‚Äôs happening is if the market tanks. Until then BCH will continue its capitulation against BTC, and you all may aswell just start saying ur ‚Äúin it for the tech‚Äù because it‚Äôs clear major price gains are not on the horizon. \\n\\nBch is simply not unique enough nor does it solve an issue that can‚Äôt be solved with something else, many a time that something else being better.Okay yes that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs amazing how I‚Äôve seen bch be used across Reddit using this function. Internet micropayments; although then there‚Äôs people from nano xlm or some other ones who claim they‚Äôre instantaneous and no fees etc. Idk. \\n\\nChain link function on here is awesomeMonero is too impractical, and doesn\\'t have the trusted Bitcoin brand.\\n\\nCashfusion + lots of peer to peer commerce is good enough.  Never had anyone refuse to trade me some \"non fungible\" BCH ever.> cannot be an effective currency\\n\\nI\\'m paying a lot of stuff online with it, it works brilliantly as a currency.Doesn\\'t matter what the market cap is. You\\'re bidding for the same miners vs the aggregate of the world\\'s commerce done on SHA256. Good luck with your 1MB premium base layer indefinitely when all commerce is being steered to 2nd layers which pay the miners nothing.Everyone knows how to use water, oxygen, houses, corn, etc, for more than investment purposes.No ones ever sent me nano, xlm, or anything else. I got a shitcoin once in a discord but thats because they were trying to romance me into running a shitcoin node. At least 10 people have tipped me since yesterday, not huge amounts but its crazy how many times it happened. I was wondering if people outside of r/btc use this function? Crazy how much I love it when yesterday I was literally saying idk about this chaintip stuff. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo ill probably make a thread asking but whats the deal why can\\'t any other crypto do something like chaintip? You said it\\'s related to chainlink, the token? Can someone break down why bch is able to do this but no one else is.Impractical enough that it‚Äôs becoming the sole use of payment for dnms, ever more so in ransomwares and otherwise any transaction that requires anonymity. What Impracticality do you speak of?\\n\\nIt really does not matter that you have Bitcoin in your name LOL. As for your other point, that‚Äôs all well and good until one day you go to deposit some bch to trade on an exchange and your account is blocked and being investigated, cos ur bch once had activity associated to a hack, dnm etc. It‚Äôs happening more and more frequently. 1 bch =//= 1bch in this case as ur bch has less effective use. You can‚Äôt sell it (easily). This cannot be Money, money is fungible, Bitcoin and its offspring are not. \\n\\nNeither are 99.9% of the market.Anecdotal evidence to be used as a basis for an argument is why I shouldn‚Äôt engage with said person, that person is stupid.And good luck with every one of your transactions being open for the entire world to watch and trace. Good luck when you receive tainted coins unknowingly.I‚Äôm not sure, but I have certainly seen the same function used in /r/cryptocurrency.. nice exposure for bch for sure> Impractical enough that it‚Äôs becoming the sole use of payment for dnms, ever more so in ransomwares and otherwise any transaction that requires anonymity. What Impracticality do you speak of?\\n\\nI tried using Monero, was laptop only and had mad sync times.\\n\\nPretty funny to say \"Monero is used in dnms\" along with BCH \"cannot be an effective currency.\", when BCH is used in way more places than Monero, so good luck with your goal post reconciliation there.You cracked cash fusion? Congrats.> And good luck with every one of your transactions being open for the entire world to watch and trace. Good luck when you receive tainted coins unknowingly.\\n\\nListen dude, first thing is I actually like and use Monero. I have a full node too installed and running (not at the moment tho).\\n\\nI get what you are trying to do.\\n\\nBut shitting on other coins, especially coins that should be friends like BCH and Monero is not the right way to do what you want to do.\\n\\nPeople do not want privacy before all, they want convenience more than they want privacy.\\n\\nAlso BCH, even without CashFusion, is not open for anybody to trace because until you identify yourself you are still **pseudonymous**.\\n\\nOnly **after you link** your coins at some point to your real life identity, you become known and it becomes a problem.\\n\\nAs long as you don\\'t give personal detail for any transaction, you can be pretty anonymous(pseudonymous) even without using Shuffling/CashFusion/Black Box solutions like Monero.\\n\\nSure, I wouldn\\'t buy drugs or guns with unmixed BCH, but for everything else its just \"private enough\" and certainly much more convenient(working 0-conf) than Monero.\\n\\nAgain, I **don\\'t** perceive Monero as a **competitor**. I think XMR is a **complementary** coin to BCH.I thought people over there just cared about moons, which I hate the moon now never thought that would be possible. \\n\\nI am very curious to know why bch can do that but monero can\\'t. I would prefer to get monero tips but I dont think its possible.‚ÄúMad sync times‚Äù - not Monero‚Äôs fault that you‚Äôre not proficient in its use, if you‚Äôd have kept at it you‚Äôd find using XMR needs not be any longer or more difficult than BCH. \\n\\nYes, sure, u can buy a few silly items using BCH like fucking coffee mugs n hoodies and shit. Crappy Chinese merchandise yeah cool lol. We‚Äôre used to settle transactions for kilos of Colombian yayo, pound upon pounds of dank buds and all the oils you can vaporise. Oh and anything else that you may wish to sell using the form of online money that‚Äôs closest in form to real cash.\\n\\nGo post your address on Twitter to earn tips, next thing couple jealous guys make one or two clicks then you‚Äôre a target. Or they see your ‚Äúanonymous crypto transaction‚Äù to g*ydaddy.com and your reputation is harmed etc.\\n\\nHell, sell a ounce of coke using bch and the financial record is there permanently for everybody in the world - and their grandkids grandkids grandkids - to see indefinitely. Bch is boring and does nothing special mate.Okay but I see it as objective fact that XMR is the superior project of the two, in nearly every aspect. Furthermore privacy is going to become a lot more sought after, with the rise of authoritarianism and leftist lunatics in charge of the USA. \\n\\nXMR is a better Bitcoin. Thus it‚Äôs a better bch. ‚ÄúComplementary‚Äù is belittling to the power that Monero has. The feds are shit scared of it as proven by their bounty.\\n\\nAlso, pseudonymity is not good enough. Opsec is where people fuck up, 99.9% of the time. Always on anonymity or nothing. \\n\\nIt is far too easy to link your identity to your wallet if your not intermediately versed in the topic of privacy.> Okay but I see it as objective fact that XMR is the superior project of the two, in nearly every aspect.\\n\\nNope it isn\\'t.\\n\\nHint: Try actually using both everyday.\\n\\nComparing to BCH, Monero is super inconvenient, super slow and unacceptable for any retail store and real businesses.\\n\\nStill, Monero is a **very good coin** that fits perfectly in its niche.\\n\\nDo I even need to tell you why is Monero unacceptable for real stores or will you figure it yourself?Lol go on tell me. Don‚Äôt even try saying speed because transactions appear instantly on Monero blockchain. Transactions are not reversible and double spend has never occurred, so there is no reason for a vendor to require block confirmations before a customer leaves the store. \\n\\nIn this instance there is zero difference with BCH, other than a technical one. But in reality you‚Äôve paid your debt the same, except now you‚Äôve maintained your right to privacy. \\n\\nBch is Monero without privacy, which is a load of crap that the market does not need.> Lol go on tell me. \\n\\nSure, no problem.\\n\\n- There are no wallets that you can use to instantly send or receive XMR. There are no mobile wallets that work the same way as BCH wallets (using somebody else\\'s Monero node doesn\\'t count).\\n- It is relatively easy to use but it requires heavy initial setup (you have to have your own node). It pretty much requires a separate computer or Raspberry Pi, doing it on a laptop will be pain\\n- It is much slower, sending a transaction on my Corei7 + Raid1(SATA) takes about 2 minutes (talking about transaction creation)\\n- !! **The balance shows 0** when your node is not synchronized - this might scare off some users. It certainly gave me a little scare at first, I thought I did something wrong for 3 seconds. Total non-starter for any kind of retail business.\\n- Your node always has to be fully synchronized to send a transaction. If it is not synchronized because it was offline for hours, you need to wait. This is a complete **show-stopper** for any kind of **commerce**.\\n- Because of above, XMR will not scale so well as BCH and is not suited for world adoption. \\n\\n**Monero XMR is basically a very good niche coin**, but it is not a world scale money and can never be.\\n\\n-------------------\\n\\nYou won\\'t magically change reality and undo these shortcomings of Monero by shouting and attacking BCH.\\n\\nThese things are absolutely **inherent and crucial** to the design of Monero and they **cannot be escaped**.\\n\\nWhat you are doing is magical thinking instead of positive thinking. Go back to reality.\\n\\nMonero is well suited for any kind of privacy solutions (drugs, firearms, medical treatments, controversial content, porn, donating to activists and political dissidents) but is not suited for normal shopping and cannot be, by design.PS.\\n\\nBy \"niche coin\" I actually mean that Monero should be in TOP3-TOP5 of coins of the world.\\n\\nThe current top 5 of coins on CMC/CoinGecko is a complete joke.\\n\\nThis is what it should look like:\\n\\n- Bitcoin Cash should be #1 (money of the world, BCH),\\n- Ethereum should be #2 to #4 (because people desire DeFi, staking and gambling more than they desire privacy)\\n- Monero should be #3 to #5 (a black box currency, highly useful despite most of people not really desiring privacy)\\n\\nAlso notice that I did not list BTC.Yeah okay you are wrong. Exodus shows my XMR incomings within seconds of sending it from Cake Wallet. All it would take for every single xmr wallet to do the same would be the simplest software update to the wallet apps LOL. \\n\\nSecond and third points are irrelevant ramblings that in two years I have not encountered whilst using Monero. Neither of these points are of any relevance to 99% of users, current or potential. You can set up a Monero wallet / node whatever you want within Minutes on major form of technology lol seriously I don‚Äôt understand what ur tryna say here. \\n\\nBalance showing as whatever it shows at is also dependant on your wallet you‚Äôre using LOOL again is this seriously your argument? Okay, use exodus wallet and your fragile lil heart won‚Äôt risk skipping a beat. \\n\\nTransactions can be sent whether the receiver is synched or not, will show up after having synched. If this is such an issue you‚Äôd have synched your blockchain before opening for business, you can also use public spend keys etc to verify the transaction even by a third party without having to sync or relinquish any important data. \\n\\nSo, every point you have made as to why XMR ‚Äúwill not scale as well as BCH‚Äù can be boiled down to rubbish. The larger the network is, the cheaper xmr transactions get. \\n\\nHash rate growing daily, aths being set constantly in transaction numbers. Monero is a real fungible currency which is NEEDED by the world, bch does nothin a million other assets don‚Äôt do.What is the technology that has allowed BCH to not be so heavily dependent on nodes?> Balance showing as whatever it shows at is also dependant on your wallet you‚Äôre using LOOL again is this seriously your argument? Okay, use exodus wallet and your fragile lil heart won‚Äôt risk skipping a beat. \\n\\nYou cannot know your balance without having scanned the blockchain fully, what are we even talking about here?\\n\\nIf the Monero node cannot show balance, how can the wallet connected to such node know balance for sure?\\n\\nIt cannot and it doesn\\'t. If the balance was somehow changed (eg. somebody sent a transaction using the same privkey), next transaction will fail while node is not fully synchronized.\\n\\nWhat are we even talking about here, you are clearly incompetent and employing wishful thinking because you want so hard for Monero to succeed.\\n\\nMonero will succeed. In fact, it has already succeeded. But it will remain a niche coin because that is how it is built.\\n\\nThere is nothing to discuss here, I am right and you are wrong but **you just want so hard to be right you will not accept any other possibility**.> What is the technology that has allowed BCH to not be so heavily dependent on nodes?\\n\\nSPV wallets, it is a Bitcoin technology, it is as old as 2014.Lol. Simply, I‚Äôm putting next to no effort into these responses, because nothing that you‚Äôve said has any relevance. You‚Äôre trying to tell me that I have to wait ages until I know my real xmr balance. \\n\\nHowever if I go log in now it take me 10 seconds to enter my password then I‚Äôm in, I can see my full complete balance as of the last transaction. It takes say 3 mins, and the blockchain is synced and any other potential incoming transactions or outgoing would show up. \\n\\nThis has never ever been any issue. I would go as far as to say that for the peace of mind that IRS beating cryptography is keeping me safe from any prying eyes, I would wait 10* as long, or pay 10* the fee. \\n\\nNow what on earth does Bitcoin cash do that Ripple, Nano, Dash, Litecoin, XLM, VET etc all do. No argument about liquidity or acceptance is even valid in today‚Äôs world of DEX‚Äôs and swap services. So go on what does BCH do better than any of them??\\n\\nAll this to say, open up a BCH chart or two and open up XMR charts. XMR has maintained a consistent uptrend since conception, making aths every two years or so. \\n\\nBCH has been in a downtrend since inception. Lol.I guess I dont understand why other coins havent implemented this tech, especially if its been around. Does BTC even have this?> because nothing that you‚Äôve said has any relevance. \\n\\nEverything I said has 100% relevance because these are my experiences as a real Monero user with his own private node that works and has all the advantages of Monero.\\n\\nBTW if you are using this \"Exodus wallet\" without being connected to a node of your own, then you \\n\\n- Don\\'t have any more privacy than you would while using BCH\\n\\n- Are not even \"using\" Monero the full way like I am using. \\n\\nYou are basically half-user, not user.\\n\\nWe are done here, there is nothing to talk about.> I guess I dont understand why other coins havent implemented this tech, especially if its been around. \\n\\nThey don\\'t care.\\n\\nActually none of other coins even want the money function. Only exceptions are Monero and Dash.\\n\\n> Does BTC even have this?\\n\\nWell yes and no.\\n\\nBTC generally has SPV support, but they intentionally broke it (0-conf) with high fees, clogged blockchain and RBF, so it no longer guaranteed that a transaction gets confirmed in the next block or 2.\\n\\nSo despite having SPV in theory, BTC is not good for payments and you need to wait for confirmations, unlike BCH where 0-conf still works.Lol. Okay mate. You may aswell be buying western union stock if you‚Äôre buying bch as a speculative investment, lol.ohhhh I see I didn\\'t make the connection that this tech would also require 0-conf. I actually was going to ask about it but figured it was unrelated and I was already asking you a lot of questions.\\n\\nDo you mind if I ask about 0-conf, basically same set of questions? Like why specifically does BCH have this seemingly important feature but no other coins? Are big blocks really that substantial, and I never realized? Could other chains implement such a thing?> Do you mind if I ask about 0-conf, basically same set of questions? Like why specifically does BCH have this seemingly important feature but no other coins? Are big blocks really that substantial, and I never realized? Could other chains implement such a thing?\\n\\nAny other PoW coin could make 0-conf work, but as I said - they don\\'t care because they do not want to be money.What do u mean about 0-conf? If u mean not waiting for block confirmations until regarding a transaction is completed - why not? Isn‚Äôt this only a real issue if there‚Äôs a possibility of a double spend (which no coin worth its salt has that issue)?

Very well done.I love the hamster-power!great comic! You forgot to mention \"watchtowers\" lolThis is amazing. Nomenclature spot on. Art stylistic. Everything about this is good.Some people are so miserable and sad about missing it, that they go to these lengths. I think I understood humans and their misery, but this subreddit has brought a whole other level to it.

I didn\\'t get that.Yeah I can\\'t even find about that on google please explain it lolhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machineWell it was a great combination of crypto and illustration, I personally loved it.It is just the affect of time on the mindset of some memers.You deserve it man. Please keep doing this.Damn this was a huge tip, he deserve it all, wish I could tip you but I can just appreciate you for now brother.I think Maxwell said it best when shrugging off blame for the dumpster fire of a scaling solution that he pushed.... You cant stop users from creating and using any l2 solutions... \\n\\nThere is a little over 3000 BTC on Lightning and well over 220000 BTC wrapped in Ethereum... The people found their own scaling solutions instead of waiting another 18 months.And what makes you think about that question in this time.Shiver me timbers! You are the first one to recognize the reference. Love everything about   that game.\\n\\nSome cool stuff on your IG! Really like the isometric tree one, so much going on there. Looking forward to your next crypto related piece.I\\'ve been on reddit for three years and chaintip is one of the most impressive things I\\'ve ever seen. This makes moons look like mcdonalds points. It\\'s amazing how fast and direct someone is able to give crypto velocity - this is starting to trigger a lot of realizations in me. Being an artist can be incredibly hard, this is better than open seas by far.>  Clip Studio Paint, i.e. not the 30 day free trial I was using!\\n\\nGood to know!\\n\\nHave fun with it.Not really, it\\'s just something I am doing.Are you suggesting it or it\\'s just a promotional comment bro?Is it safe?For typical small purchase transactions, BCH zero-conf is safe to use in under three seconds, particularly if your client supports double spend proofs.\\n\\nLN is faster but also prone to fail, BCH txns practically always confirm.Could I translate into Spanish? The Argentinian community will surely like it.Yea bro, and just today my post about challenging views of this sub got deleted, I didnt insult, I didnt flame, I was just challenging views and pointing out how this subreddit was created as a safe space for those who have missed the fun and now they need to watch from the sidelines. Thats about \"This is not the censored cult\" bcs, to be honest, I have never seen that an echo chamber could be formed so fast. And most if not absolutely all of this has been created bcs of the jealousy... Do you want to know how I know? Bcs we have seen all of this. We have seen so many iterations of you, and it comes and goes every new cycle.. We have been dealing with the naysayers for years and still we are ever stronger. When the history is written, you should know that you have been on the wrong side, along with all of your circle jerking friends around here.

They are sometimes less clear in their intentions while typing online.The Rube Goldberg machine is basically a machine that looks stupid complicated, but all it does is simple things.\\n\\nFor example, a marble track that activates a rc helicopter that cuts the wires of a rope to lower a bridge for a toy car to slide down and flip a lever which just activates a fan that knocks out a jenga tower that presses a button just to open the lights.I was searching rune goldberg machine lolthat\\'s a startling statistic. I feel like eth is doomed though...Bro wbtc is being staked for defi, it\\'s not intended or used as a scaling solutionI am influenced by it to a stupid degree. I think the Woodtick suite music plays in my head like most of the time.Nothing can really come close to chaintip, or BCH. Only a massive disinformation campaign could keep a lid on this thing. And yeah, I do find NFTs kinda silly, if anyone who tipped me wants to ‚Äúown‚Äù this comic, ‚Äúright click / save as‚Ä¶‚Äù is right there.But like it wasn\\'t possible before igYebb! I did join their Telegram group yesterday and invested 2BNB to buyyeah I think their project is potential, you should def read about this projectYes that\\'s what I like about bch. It actually works all the time.Wow, sounds like I‚Äôm missing a lot of fun.I\\'ll continue to keep an eye out for them. I report them for violating r/btc rules and for reddit wide Spam, since they are spamming others subs, not just r/btcWaaaaa people arent using Lightning and using solutions that work today and not in 18 months waaaaaa. Bitpay is now accepting WBTC waaaaaaaaüòÇEnabling new use cases is another dimension of scaling.  In some sense every nonscaling innovation in BTC is worthless.  The bus is full, no need to serve sna ks, add wifi or otherwise enhance the experience.  In another sense of course, new features could mean that BTC is used for greater value transfer (and greater fee) per byte. But BTC onchain is already moving up the payments pyramid, from personal use to corporate to funds to countries based on its 1st mover advantage so...hopefully we cant start being more empathetic towards people who believe the disinformation. I feel like its really easy to miss if you\\'re not paying attention - and its so easy not to pay attention. I feel like I got into crypto early enough I just barely made the cutoff point for having some real working knowledge. I really feel a lot of empathy towards people trying to learn these days, there are so many land mines for them its crazy. \\n\\nThey wont even make it anywhere near the btc / bch debate. To even get to this debate you have to be aware of years of history and its specific signifigance. Someone just telling you bch is better than btc is meaningless, we get 10 posts a day with thousands of upvotes saying what coin will be the next bitcoin. The bullshit is sincearly baffling our brains. Having this realization is eye opening for me because I feel like someone who spends as much time looking into things should have made these connections already. There is great effort being put into creating a 51% attack of bullshit. \\n\\nIf there is more disinformation than information, you just edited history and created your own reality.The meme I will make tonight wont be nearly as original as yours, but I will happy to know im in good company. \\n\\nI\\'ve considered getting a drawing tablet things for about 10 years. I got a laptop with a touch screen but apparently its not the kind that works for drawing and my muscle memory is all mouse anyway - touching the screen on a pc is very clunky for me. I barely can do it on a android. \\n\\nI have no way to create a digital drawing and I never really tried it because im an old fart. Maybe I\\'ve really been denying myself a chance to be good at something.I imagine you are no newcomer if all these things have been obvious for you for so long. What do you think of people like me who didn\\'t have a clue for so long but still participated in crypto? I\\'ve been harsh to newcomers myself, now I feel stupid knowing I was hardly right the whole time.I\\'m super skeptical of nft valuations in general, but you shouldn\\'t completely dismiss the value of them. The value is not the content. It is proof of various things that you couldn\\'t easily prove in the past. These proofs are valuable when they are social proofs, e.g.:\\n\\n- intelligence\\n- vision\\n- discernment\\n- luck!\\n- ...\\n\\nSo being able to prove that I had the vision to recognize an early artist who would become famous (nevermind the feedback loops here...) is a valuable thing. Or to recognize that a particular piece of art will be the centerpiece of a revolution, etc.\\n\\nIt can be accomplished in other ways but NFTs make it direct, explicit, and tradeable.\\n\\nGreat comic! /u/chaintip $5> But like it wasn\\'t possible before ig\\n\\nActually it will become possible for anybody once Molecular finishes his automation tipping software.\\n\\n/u/molecccOhh I see it, you are all so goodhearted n shit, willing to discuss and be open bla bla bla... and thats all you got... You guys are so full of shit its starting to pour out of your mouth. xDDD Dont bother to reply, I aint reading more from this shitholeI checked and one of them claims his PC was hacked, I wonder if it isn\\'t well organised ransomware/virus attack.\\n\\nCould be or could be not. Maybe we will find out.pwned, legend18 months?I definitely think a purpose built drawing tablet is good to have. It is a great enabler of stupid little ideas that would be too much trouble to follow through with if you had to get out your art supplies, do it on paper, scan it, etc. Having the option to draw straight to digital has made me do a lot more creative stuff than I would have bothered to try. Only in the last year or two have the screen tablets come down enough in price, they used to be insanely expensive. I recommend the Huion ones, they have been giving Wacom a serious run for their money.I‚Äôm no expert, and I try not to treat it like a team sport. Everyone is welcome and everyone takes time to sort out the facts for themselves.\\n\\nI am critical of the cultishness and censoriousness of the BTC crowd, and I think they have become that way because they can no longer win a debate on the merit of their arguments. And so a lot of emotion and forcefulness has entered into the equation from their side. But if they somehow convinced me again using facts that BTC is the best decentralized medium of exchange, then I‚Äôd be right back on their side. I am pretty blockchain agnostic, if it works the best to pay for hot dogs and cab rides, then I like it.Thank you!! Yeah, I guess I would be a pretty cool guy if I had an NFT from Picasso back when he was a no name shmuck. But speculation seems to have run rampant such that the actual art/artist is just an afterthought, compared to the hope that somebody else will pay more for it later. Maybe the NFT idea will end up mostly being used for something smarter than visual art that we haven‚Äôt thought of yet‚Ä¶ seems like a smart way to prove when you invented something, for example, rather than a patent..> I\\'m super skeptical of nft valuations in general, but you shouldn\\'t completely dismiss the value of them. The value is not the content. It is proof of various things that you couldn\\'t easily prove in the past.\\n\\nYou are right.\\n\\nThe real actual value of NFT is not the cryptographic proof of ownership itself.\\n\\nIf humanity was based on logic and reason, NFT would be worthless. But it\\'s not.\\n\\nHumanity is based on following/being followed, being able to present yourself as unique, to get more prestige and ultimately become perceived as an alpha and get more women, which will ultimately result in reproductive success. This is why I can make a blind guess that will turn out true with 98%+ probability that **practically only men are buying NFTs**. Because it\\'s men that want to present themselves as unique no matter the price.\\n\\nActual value of NFTs is not the NFTs itself, but being able to say: \"Look, I am so awesome and unique, I own this, it\\'s the only one of its kind in the world.\"\\n\\nIt all becomes instantly clear once you understand how humanity works.***\\nu/0hWell0kay, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2kwccpg54vq6z57jzw5rpsekvhhuv423dchh) `0.00788231 BCH` | `~4.99 USD` by u/emergent_reasons\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***Everything is on one side and the luck on the other, and then you go.Yeah I know he is working on it.

LmaoOhh okay but I was thinking like the bot could read the word and replace it with a number? Is there a catch?Oh that\\'s the reasonI think the guy realized he wont be able to tip me due to lightning still not working and dropped the topic.\\n\\nI specifically choose non-custodial wallets to show him the tech doesnt stand on its own when not propped up by custodial solutions. \\n\\nHes replied elsewhere since, everywhere but to my invoice requesting 1 satü§îExcellent comic btw, keep them comic.

Either bitcoin was dead then, or BCH isn\\'t now. Can\\'t be both.And it took only 3 hours to mine it?  AMAZINGThey both have their own importance in their place, and I love both of them.ehhh... alternate headline: BCH fails to mine a block for 3 hours! \\n\\nNot a good thing.Uhhh, any comment on the 3 hours it took to mine one block?isn\\'t it a bigger deal that it took 3 hours for a block?I see a steady increase in the price of BCH .Many don\\'t acknowledge that.you have miners purposely not mining blocks to decrease difficulty.Okay, and? A 5.5 MB block isn\\'t anywhere close to a record for BCH.\\n\\nHell, it only got that large because there was a dearth of blocks for a while.Took 3hr to mine the block or previous block didn\\'t include transactions?Pretty cool. lolBitcoin Cash is so good. It\\'s what we came here for. _Peer to peer electronic cash._How do you enjoy being a tiny block lover?Have been transacting a lot of BTC last few days... works great. I would choose BCH for day to day expenses, but when I am dealing with large amounts, BTC gives me peace of mind.Unfortunately, I think that this posts shows that very few people still care about BCH.This sub went from \"BTC will be the new altcoin really soon\" to \"well, at least our block size is better\" pretty quickhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dMrImMedYRoBCH fails in the block but the it is not dead yet, have happened with the Bitcoin in the past.We are waiting for the flight to the moon üöÄ .XddddddApple Orange comparison\\n\\nA few years ago, crypto was very different to what is todayThe market is so unpredictable man, no body can say what about to happen next.They can\\'t predict the right thing because no one actually knows the future.This is fucking amazing, and this will make me insane now.When china closed shop to miners Bitcoin had that regularly for days. Except blocks were no where near close to 5mb. That wasnt amazing.\\n\\nPeople dont understand hashrate variance.It\\'s a good thing not having a backlog after that block, because ALL the transactions waiting make it into the first block, even at 5x\\n\\nIt\\'s also a good thing that instant transactions are pretty safe in BCH, instead of 100% vulnerable to double-spend in BTC (due to congestion + RBF). So most people didn\\'t really have to wait anything.Three-hour blocks occasionally happen with BTC too.It took 18 hours for a BTC transaction to confirm for me when I paid the recommended fee.  \\nIt is in the nature of probability that these long confirmation times occur.  Nothing to do with BCH - it can happen to BTC also and the effects would be far reaching because BTC operates at the limits of its viability.Another alternate headline.... BTC transaction sits in the mempool for 2 weeks and never gets mined.It\\'s also not the end of the world.At least on block in BTC was over an hour to wait. The hashrate went down.Thats inevitable on either coin though. Thats not a failing of BCH, thats just how the design works.\\n\\nThe failing is what the repercussions are, and for BCH there are none...all the tx go through and everything is fine. On BTC the block is full and everything grinds to a halt.alt alt headline: bch fully clears mempool with single block under normal variance \\n\\n(((just like Satoshi intended and BTC used to from 2009 to 2013.)))But don\\'t you think about the fee which will affected after the block.looks like hashrate dropped 30% just today.Well it would be better to stay quiet until I have got the proof.No, it makes no difference for the functioning of the coin for most payments.\\n\\nException: Payments for money/money trades and very large payments.Nah not a big one for the large deals, in my mind it is pretty nice.Many know the price will definitely increase so they don\\'t bother it.No the BCH difficulty algorythm can\\'t be gamed like that. \\n\\nIt\\'s just normal variance.Yeah, but if that variance happened to BTC it\\'d take another 5+ to clear rather than the next block.Having to listen to small blockers for years during the scaling debate, this will always give me a kick.  \\n\\nMaybe you weren‚Äôt around then.The formerYeah it\\'s so confusing, I didn\\'t get that, somebody explain it lolGod stop that XD someone is trying to find answers brother XDDDWhat piece of mind do you get from BTC transactions that you don\\'t get from BCH transactions?Dumbest comment on here.Really? I guess people must be [losing interest in BTC too](https://fork.lol/tx/txs) then, since BCH has been steadily gaining on BTC tx over time.HAHAHAHA oh my god it\\'s so bad but so damn true tho!!!!!!Get the f outta here w scamsStill with this shit!  reported.No its not at all. 3 years ago I was told BCH is a dead coin because it only hit \"x\" amount of transactions, while BTC was hitting \"y\" amount of transactions.\\n\\nIf BCH is now hitting that same same number of transactions that made BTC a booming coin, then by their definition bch is now a booming coin. \\n\\n\\nYou can\\'t call yourself successful because you made a million dollars, then say the guy behind you isn\\'t a success when he so makes a million dollars. That is moving the goalposts.Exactly, crypto is not that low class and in popular as it was in the start.Yeah it\\'s crazyAnd BCH does that on regular basis.Username does not check out.\\n\\nWise but polite.>It\\'s also a good thing that instant transactions are pretty safe in BCH\\n\\nTell that to most exchanges, who have a wait time of 2 - 10 blocks to clear BCH deposits. Block time and variance does matter quite a bit!\\n\\nIt\\'s sad that the new DAA didn\\'t fix things.I can agree with your points, it\\'s a good thing to have BCH.Correctwhen was the last time?Absolutely but still there are many people afraid of BTH I don\\'t know why.Can you provide the source of this information sir? like an article or something please.Link?but it can be if what they are saying is true or something like that!It isThen recovered as it always does. Miners just swapped around due to the DARI.The Miners are who provide the network security, not the nodes. 0-conf transactions are convenient but isn\\'t the revolutionary part about bitcoin that Satoshi Nakamoto figured out, that prevented online cash for so long (double spending), the part where miners confirm it?Oh no, it would be much worse than that. You can only clear 5MB of txns in five smallblocks if those blocks are mostly empty.\\n\\nIf there\\'s only 100KB of slack space in the typical smallblock it would take 50 blocks to clear a 5MB backlog.True, the world was going to end with big blocks.\\n\\nUntil, predictably, it didn\\'t.except BCH is the small block chain - the total blockchain size is less than half of what bitcoin is.\\n\\nTotal blockchain size is the thing that effects centralization more it makes it harder for people to run nodes and longer for them to sync to the tip.Took a look at the BCH/BTC chart today for the first in years. Ya\\'ll ruined yourselves. Enjoy that all time low. Can\\'t make shit compared to btc but you can always make delusion, so enjoy it.lolBecause i already have btc... so sending it is easy. Plus the long history of secure transactions.BTC keeps rising in value. BCH has lost over 80% if it\\'s value since its all time high.  At any point of time since the BCH fork, anyone that hasn\\'t sold their BCH for BTC, has lost a fuck ton of money.  Evey person that did sell their BCH for BTC, has made money.You really like using that. Lol.....Is that way bch just dropped below 1% of btc for the first time? I remember when it was 20%. I never thought it would go below 10%. But practically everyone left bch.It\\'s a three hour block, no one is mining it.I like your logic but not sure if it‚Äôs just because I hold BCH üòÜAny decent coins make new ATH this year while BCH is doing what, not even getting to half of its ATH\\n\\nSo whoever said bch is a dead coin is 100% correct lol\\n\\nI\\'ll put it in context for you\\n\\n3 years ago, during ATH, the crypto market has 750billion mcap\\n\\nCurrently, crypto market has 2.67 trillion mcapThat gave me some relief, thanks for answering that mate.I dont think 5mb blocks are regular on BCH but you certainly wont see so many transactions packed into a Bitcoin block.Users have to make their way polite but they have to be loud sometimes.> Tell that to most exchanges, who have a wait\\n\\nJust because they wait for an excessive number of blocks it doesn\\'t mean they \"have\" to. Also why do I have to go and execute your idea? You are welcome to help, this is decentralized money.688,191 took over an hour in June.[Try this](https://www.google.com/)>\\tIt is\\n\\nIt is inherent to PoW.always does? that\\'s why ath is 7EH and it recovered to what 1.5?But how miners just swapped around due to the DARI can you explain more?That is true, but the fact is that the finality of a transaction is high even before it is included in the block, the most important reason is the high capacity, transactions total up to 32 MB goes into the next block, that is about 100x the normal, 10 min block, utlilized capacity.\\n\\nEdit: BTW, a single confirmation was not traditionally regarded as safe, due to orphans, 6 confirmations was the standard back in the day. Exemplified by how Electrum displays it, you get the green tick on the tx after 6 conf.\\n\\nWith 6 conf, the block time variation means less.Nodes do not propagate bad transactions therefore nodes also play a role in network security, particularly 0-conf security.Those were odd times:\\n\\n2MB is too centralizing. Also, segwit lets us do blocks bigger than 2MB.\\n\\nCognitive dissonance++Pruning5 MB half of BTC\\'s blocksize, huh?\\n\\n\\nYou are just trolling, moving to actual usage in stead of the max size. So predictable from just a normal, irrational BTC troll.this sub is refusing to acknowledge this for 4 years but maybe your post will do the trick.Very few people have been ruined.  I see a steady increase in the price of BCH and an increasing number of places to spend it at.BTC has lost 80% of its value at least 3 or 4 times.Yup, selling my bch the second I could was one of my best crypto decisions.You really are a dumbfuckA joke crypto made after a dog meme that almost no one was working on a year ago is worth 34 Bln dollars as I write this.\\n\\nThis is a marathon not a sprint.The market is irrational, there\\'s no denying that. It\\'s been good for me in terms of accumulation :) There\\'s a ton of activity going on, just very little activity in this subreddit compared to Telegram/Discord/WeChat.\\n\\nI refer back to the increasing tx. At this rate BCH may surpass BTC in 2022.That\\'s not how any of this works.\\n\\n1. It was just variance\\n\\n2. Difficulty adjustment is a thing, and actually far more effective on BCH than BTC, so the different hash rate as well as fluctuations in hash rate, are far less of a problembirdman and birdbrain.If 3 hours for first confirmation is critical then BTC has already lost.This should help improve his logic - u/chaintipWe don\\'t define success by price. We define success by how useful Bitcoin Cash is as a currency.And BCH is still a top-20 coin, and has more retail transactions than almost all coins. BCH is supported on 99% of exchanges, and is part of greyscale, a is one of the few projects several banks and funds recomend.\\n\\nBCH was also the victim of the fork. After the fork there was a lot of price discovery while the market decided what it\\'s value was, and we were seeing the community and devs join one side or the other.\\n\\nNot to mention the fact that BCH was pretty much declared the enemy of the largest coin, and community in the space.\\n\\nZCash\\'s price history is worse than BCH, and it\\'s development has been lacking. Yet ZCash is still seeing adoption, and even just got added to greyscale. BCH has 100x the transactional volume, and 10x the market of cap of ZCash. \\n\\nBCH is not a dead coin. It\\'s in the top-20 of a $2.6tril market. Yeah, it hasn\\'t seen the adoption of BTC, but it doesn\\'t have the name recognition, and BCH didn\\'t sell out to the establishment.We\\'re talking about 3 hour blocks though.Yes, [1.5 area](https://fork.lol/pow/hashrate).What are your thoughts for the reason the block time is 10 minutes rather than 1 minute? Litecoin\\'s 2.5min blocktime is something I find really attractive, but I don\\'t know the reason for a 10 minute blocktime and maybe it\\'s a good reasonyou still need to download the full blockchain during the sync and apply pruning when you save>total blockchain size\\n\\nvs\\n\\n>BTC\\'s blocksize\\n\\ndude is your ego so big it effects your reading comprehension?\\n\\nhttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/charts/blockchain-sizeHaha, the trolling thing make it more worse in my mindset.Is that so? Not the people trying to use BCH wallets as Bitcoin wallets because they are tricked by propaganda that it IS Bitcoin and then by the intentional design of the wallets lose all their money, at a Bitcoin domain and btc subreddit? Not those tricked into buying this shit with all their bitcoin back when it was 0.15-0.3 btc per bch? It\\'s literally at 0.00989 as I type, you don\\'t think that opportunity cost and misinformation hurt anyone? You justify that insane shit to yourself all you want, the facts speak for themselves. The fact is you promote a scam and people have been hurt because of it. You sold this shit when Bitcoin was at 3k and you haven\\'t seen 3k since. That\\'s the truth. The closest you came was in late 2017 when Coinbase pulled that scammy insider trading listing. Get with the facts. You have bene hurting people. Price has not been steadily increasing. You\\'re just outright lying.Triggered! Such a well thought out reply to refute my facts. Another fine example of the American education system.Lol yea a dog meme coin is worth more than bcash. That should tell you something.Moving bcash back and forth between two of your wallets does not mean more people are adopting it lol.That\\'s exactly how this works. You either don\\'t have enough miners online to contribute enough hash to mine the blocks and it takes three hours, or you have miners purposely not mining blocks to decrease difficulty.

It makes the system less efficient. Bitcoin Cash combination of 0-conf with 10min block times is an inspired and a credit to Nakamito\\'s brilliance. No Bitcoin Cash merchants would have even noticed the 3hr block interval for example.For now 2.5 minutes works just as fine as 10 min. 12 years ago, the latency of the internet was higher than now. But for the future, with larger blocks, I still think 10 mins is a good compromise between no lower limit and infinite limit.\\n\\nIt has to be really small if you rely on confirmation at a cash register, less than 1 sec. So we don\\'t rely on that. There are other ways, two ways can be utilized for BCH soon, that is double spend proofs, not yet fully implemented, and a new idea, an escrow contract making a double spend cost more than what can be won by being dishonest.> you still need to download the full blockchain during the sync and apply pruning when you save\\n\\n\\nNo you don\\'t, not with UTXO commitments - all you actually need is the *currently* valid UTXO set that all miners are using, attested to by PoW.\\n\\n\\n\\nRunning a node will be even more useful with UTXO commitments - as anyone running a node can point to consecutive  UTXO commitments and demonstrate to the World **without everyone having to download and verify from Genesis**\\n\\n\\n* That the second commitment does not follow from the first by *just applying the transactions of the block in between* --> MINER MALFEASANCE!!!\\n\\n\\nUltimately keeping the miners even more in check, should you find the incentives in the White Paper lacking.\\n\\n\\nUTXO commitments truly elevates the usefulness of running a node on BCH - safeguarding everyone.\\n\\n\\n* **As those who do can *PROVE* miner malfeasance to those that don\\'t in a very compact form.** \\n\\n\\nSomething not possible in the BTC World - a BTC user would have to *take your word for it* or run a node themselves and sync from Genesis\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe above assurance is a vital piece of the Big Block Puzzle - do you need to know about every transaction that happened over a year ago? probably not \\n\\n\\nBut you would probably like to know that there has been no *miner malfeasance* in the past \\n\\n\\nGiven the the *extremely* low bar that at least 1 whistle blower can run a node, the fact that they can then **alert and more importantly *compactly* PROVE to the whole community** that some shenanigans has happened is a game changer.\\n\\n\\nIf there is no whiff of this on the internet, you can be relatively sure it has not happened, \\'no news is good news\\' is not as strong as verifying from Genesis but it gets us a long way there, and makes Big Blocks far more feasible.UTXO commitmentsLN can never scaleYou have two different things:\\n\\nThe max block size\\n\\nThe current utilization\\n\\nYou are just playing a game of thumbing down fishballs in a pot.You talk about ego, but you are talking out of your arse.  The whole centralisation thing is vastly over-eggedThere has been no trickery at all.  Only a fool would not know the difference between BCH and BTC.\\n\\nMore people lost money because they were told to sell their BCH.\\n\\nBCH is not a scam, it is sound money for all the world and the only reason you are here is because you see BCH as a threat.  We have more utility and the price of the coin is 1 100\\'th of the price of BTC.\\n\\nThe times that you are talking about were just after the fork and everybody knew about BTC and BCH.  I have both, but some idiots sold their BCH.Literally both coins at their bottom in December of 2018 have gone up 9x. Anyone holding BCH made just as much money as bcore. You literally don\\'t know what you are talking about and trying to spread lies.It might appear significant to an idiot.Afraid of competitors, huh? :)Y\\'know, it kinda says something that you\\'d even be able to do this on BCH.  \\n\\n\\nImagine being like ETH... forced hodl because of gas fees, lol. Who needs diamond hands when you can have gas hands instead?  \\n\\n\\nOr imagine being like BTC... forced hodl because your transaction never sees the light of day for two weeks during congestion.Days destroyed refutes you.Sometimes miners have to go through 1% of the search space before they find a block, and sometimes 99%.\\n\\nBTC also has blocks that are over an hour. But unlike with BTC, you have now guarantee you get in the to the next block.\\n\\nAt times with BTC, people are waiting 2 weeks for a confirmations. BCH will never have that.> That\\'s exactly how this works\\n\\nNope. If price goes down in BCH, or up in BTC, hashing power goes down. Same happens the other way. The difference is BCH reacts much faster due to a better algorithm, while BTC can get stuck forever.smartbch is cutting edge, and bch development is 5 years ahead of btc. btc does not even have schnorr signatures!What\\'s special about BTC then üòÇIt\\'s not that I\\'m happy about it, but there are a lot of factors to that. The price doesn\\'t solely dictate success. I agree if it is constantly losing everyone money then it won\\'t work. But it\\'s used more than almost any crypto for transactions, which is exactly what it was designed to do, and exactly what btc has been failing to do for 4 years. Almost all of my cryptonsales have been in bch despite offering other cryptos, including lightning. If BCH is truly a threat to the fiat establishment, we will certainly see more price suppression, and restance from the establishment  cryptos.

No matter what date anyone bought your scam shitcoin, they\\'d have more money if they bought Bitcoin. And none of your bullshit cherry picking changes that fact.lol good luck. You‚Äôll need it. Bcash falls and bitcoin go upYes, the largest computing network in the world getting stuck forever.\\n\\nCute you have to read through my reddit history to think of something? I stop responding when there\\'s no response to be had.There is constant work in progress to improve the efficiency of BCH.  We are quite aware of the challenges of scaling and are taking steps to make the use of BCH trouble free - in contrast to the mess that is BTC sidechains.You are a fucking idiot troll and your post doesn\\'t even make sense.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what you are talking about regarding segwit.  I never send to a segwit address when I send BTC.  Segwit is an invention of the core developers to facilitate the lightning network with a view to taking income from the miners and filling the pockets of the core developers and their masters the investors in Blockstream.  It is you that should be ashamed for pushing this perversion of Satoshi\\'s invention.\\n\\nBitcoin Cash is the true bitcoin in all but name.  BTC is a coin with a lousy user experience that is not the Bitcoin that was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, but if you are one of those associated with it, I hope that you enjoy the 30 pieces of silver you gain for your greed and treachery while you can for the days of BTC are numbered.So you are one of the cunts who moderates the Bitcoin subreddit.  You have got a fucking nerve coming here when many people here are banned from your subreddit because you can\\'t tolerate free discussion.\"I mean, they tried. It\\'s only because of an intolerant minority and that we stand as sovereign node runners that they failed.

I\\'m concerned.\"\\n\\nAnd so you should be.  We\\'re telling the truth and in the end the truth will prevail.Thanks, but I haven\\'t needed luck for a long time now. :) \\n\\nJust keep in mind that you\\'re betting on a Bitcoin that Satoshi would not have supported.\\n\\n>In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for [mining] nodes.

We tolerate free expression here unlike in the swamp that you inhabit.  You are the one who is spamming and your posts here are public for all to see.  Your lies about BTC are exposed here.

For Bitcoin Cash once your transaction is added to the mempool, you\\'re good, which means instantly. This is something Bitcoin **can\\'t do** as it has (RBF) Replace By Fee so someone could double spend.Nope. Only the time it takes for the transaction to broadcast plus a seconds \"grace period\" to rule out double spending likelihood. So, all in all about 2 secs..I also have some curiosity, do we have to wait 10 minuteshell yeah indeed Let the superior tech win this time!This is one of the reason why I hate Bitpay so much, always disappoints peopleIt won\\'t happen so soon bro, be patient maybe some miracle will do that stuff lol***\\nu/MemoryDealers, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay23j7zhsfnawldzmx3a67dw6tlleuemr6fj3p) `0.00203708 BCH` | `~1.27 USD` by u/rbtc-tipper\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***Most people tend to choose the former in front of their interests and ideals, and I am one of the majority!The current [transaction fee for BTC is $16](https://bitcoinfees.co/)! If these \"shopping malls, restaurants and gas stations\" once accepted BTC as you say, they don\\'t anymore. No one will pay $16 in fees.\\n\\nBlockstream changed the vision of BTC. Maybe you didn\\'t get the memo.\\n\\nIf you want to use Bitcoin as cash, use Bitcoin Cash.Yeah absolutely it\\'s getting more popular nowadays!!!Nah bro, it\\'s not that special  but this is new and fresh!This is coindrop-musk scam again, as a picture this time.Ye but usually with payments companies, they are super upfront with their personal identities since they require consumers to trust in their centralized services.You select the \"GoCrypto\" payment method at the checkout. They support several coins, including BCH. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfshAN27bKPe4f3uBIr7jjA/videosInteresting. Didn‚Äôt know about that. Thanks for the answer!There is still a small chance (a few %) for doing a succesful double broadcast double spend, but only within the first 1-2 seconds, so most payment receivers just wait 1-2 secs after the transaction broadcast is detected after which it is close to impossible to double spend. \\nThere is even a method to make 0-conf even safer, esspecially for larger amounts - use DS Proofs which is a fairly new verification method added to BCH nodes.This answer was perfect, thanks for the information mate really appreciate it!Usually not, unless the merchant requires a confirmation.\\n\\nOn BCH, it is possible to accept payments with 0 confirmations. It is up to the merchant really. For some businesses like exchanges this is not always practical (although they could do it for small amounts and identified depositors).\\n\\nFor online merchants who can withhold the goods or services if a double spend is detected, it would also be possible.\\n\\nFor brick&mortar stores it is certainly possible to do 0-conf, given that they would know within about 3-5 seconds whether you tried to scam them, and then they can usually alert the security or call the police, or have you on camera.\\n\\nIf you are transacting p2p with someone, e.g. you are selling something in return for BCH, then you can decide whether to wait for 0 or more confirmations depending on the amount.\\n\\nIf I was selling something big like a car, I would wait for 1 confirmation. For something only up to a few thousand dollars, I would accept 0-conf and wait a few seconds to check if a double spend proof was generated (this would show that the other person sent another transaction spending the same funds during that time).\\n\\nMost good wallets on BCH either let you respend unconfirmed funds or enable this via setting. So if you received some money you can immediately spend it. In that case however, the receiver might want to wait until it has a confirmation unless the amount is trivial.I don\\'t hold bitcoins now because the price is too high and fluctuates up and down, I sold all my bitcoins and then I moved to mining, much safer and stable and very profitableI mean I have no clue. I dont like companies that sound like \"ligma\"Another company strarted accepting crypt. \"crypto be like now i will fly as i have drinked red bull\".OK very cool... I did some digging and managed to find a map of stores that accept it.\\n\\nStill this post makes no sense to me.  Did they mean to say: \"GoCrypto allows businesses to accept Bitcoin Cash\"?  Because it really doesn\\'t seem consumer facing.Been spending BCH at merchants for years (without payment processor) and it has been instantaneous with zero conf. Never a single glitch. Working as designed.> Thanks for the answer!\\n\\nThat is not actualy the answer.\\n\\nYou were right in the first place, unless you have at least a single confirmation your transaction is still in the mempool and can be replaced by another transaction.  The chances are not that great unless you add an outrageous fee on the double spend (or do some other trick) but it still can happen.\\n\\nIt really comes down to the risk that the vernor wants to take.I learned that I have also invested in cryptocurrency for a long time, but have never used it to buy things in realityballs\\n\\nReminds me of Updog.BUt they have to accept the trend or they will be like old fashioned and no one will use itGoCrypto makes a POS system and API that supports both crypto and credit cards for shops.True, BCH is so good, even I never found any glitches while doing any trasaction.This is similar to robbing a store. Yes it is possible but not likely while a camera recording your face.>still in the mempool and can be replaced by another transaction\\n\\nRubbish.\\n\\nBitcoin Cash works on the first seen principle. As a transaction propagates over the BCH network, it locks each node against a second transaction that spends the same inputs. Therefore a second transaction can not replace an earlier one.\\n\\nIt is theoretically possible to introduce both transactions at the same time with the result that half the network will be locked against one and the other half the other, with the hope that the fraudulent one will be mined in the bad half and the good one seen by the merchant.\\n\\nNot only is this is exceptionally hard to do on the Bitcoin Cash network, it is very easily detected by the merchant which will arrest you for shoplifting whether the double spend succeeds or not.> Reminds me of Updog.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s Updog?\\n\\n\\nMy favourite character u/chaintipDog is up just you need to get from it  and start from it now.Thanks that is more clearTrue, but I prefer that people actualy know the risks instead of lying to them and saying it is not possible.> Bitcoin Cash works on the first seen principle.\\n\\nI see no consensus rule for that.

Even with credit card. Instant 0-Conf transactions on BCH is no riskier than credit card fraud.\\n\\nAt the end of the day 0-Conf acceptance should be based on economic feasibility. Just like anything in this world, good enough, works.In the beginning of Bitcoin Cash, RBF was reverted.\\n\\nSince then, I don\\'t know of a single BCH node which does not follow the first-seen-safe rule.\\n\\nIt may not be a formal consensus rule, but it is a well known rule inherited from the original Bitcoin, which BCH developers strive to protect.What? The whole point of blockchain is to solve the double spend problem.\\n> We   need   a   way   for   the   payee   to   know   that   the   previous   owners   did   not   sign   any   earlier \\ntransactions.

From memory it was about 2010-2011 (soon after Slush\\'s pool was set up) we discovered the economics of following that rule.  Just about instantly pools diverged on how they enforced those rules to enhance their profit.  They are still doing it to this day, gaming blocks to maximize their income.  I imagine it is the same today with bitcoin cash, it is in the miners best interest to maximize their returns and that is an essential part of the game theory of crypto.\\n\\nAnything not enforced in consensus requires trust, and you know the phrase, don\\'t trust etc.Still not a consensus rule.You are the one that\\'s doing the lieing by arguing in absolutes when it fits your agenda.\\n\\nThere are always risk. That\\'s why people make compromises. 0-Conf on BCH is good enough to buy Gasoline and pretty much any below $1000.\\n\\n0-Conf on BTC however does not work for any type/amount purchase, as per design by the banker\\'s backed developers, to prevent bitcoin tech being used in Point-Of-Sale as \"instant payment\".They need to lie so they could earn more than anyboody thats the real reason of crash.0-conf to n-conf is a spectrum and even confirmed transactions should not be treated as safe. It is a matter of deciding how much proof of work you require to accept a certain payment. Every participant is free to choose that for themselves on a case by case basis.\\n\\nThis is in fact how Bitcoin has worked since the beginning.\\n\\nAs you point out, RBF or CPFP did nothing to stop miner/pool games.\\nWhere there is profit, network participants will seek it, that is to be expected. Yet Bitcoin (and Bitcoin Cash) continue to work despite these games, because the overriding system incentives dominate.\\n\\nBitcoin Cash added Double Spend Proofs, which protect unconfirmed transactions against fraudulent doublespends unless a miner colludes (and for that there will be further mechanisms developed which are already specified, like Zero-Conf Escrow (ZCE))> You are the one that\\'s doing the lieing by arguing in absolutes when it fits your agenda best.\\n\\nHow does this line up with this:-\\n\\n> There are always risk. \\n\\nIn two sentences you just contradicted yourself.\\n\\nIs there risk or isn\\'t there?  Make your mind up.Just a note on miner colluding. 0-conf is for small payments which is an inspired match for a BCH payment system as the global median cash spend is just $15.\\n\\nA miner is typically a multimillion dollar business so would they really collude with me, risking their business, to defraud a coffee shop of a $4 coffee?> 0-conf to n-conf is a spectrum and even confirmed transactions should not be treated as safe.\\n\\nFor goodness sake, all I am doing is saying that you should tell newbies the truth, I could not care less how you want to justify it.\\n\\nDon\\'t lie to noobs.Dont drive.

How could reasonable people saying changing open source software is against the code? How can intelligent people say that blocks would be too big if we changed the code to fix an obvious problem in the future.\\n\\nI decided to see for myself. I googled \"what did satoshi think about the block size.\"\\n\\nLook at his comment, it\\'s not some preachy ethical report about not mutating code. It\\'s literally the code to fix it. Look at that. That tells us everything we need to know about our attitudes towards the code.\\n\\nIt\\'s meant to be changed. It\\'s an open source software able to be changed by anyone. The idea we were given a final product which should never change like a constitution is absurd. Satoshi himself did not consider the code to be some unchanging mystical work, he gave us a project to work on and plenty of homework to do. He is no longer here to easily give us bug fixes in one comment, and if he did we clearly wouldn\\'t care anymore. It\\'s obvious.\\n\\nSatoshi knows what the only solution is. It\\'s why he kept his horde of coins. Who here will blame the master when he has come to destroy his wicked creation?BCH is freedom money. It is as good as it getsinb4 something something religious text\\nA Block size increase requires a Hard Fork.\\n\\n\\nArguably **a non hardforking 1MB (non witness) Bitcoin**  is the *HARDEST MONEY* in all Crypto (most like Gold) as it **GUARANTEES**\\n\\n\\n1. There will only ever be 21 million BTC - (no hard forks)\\n\\n\\n2. Older coins cannot be disenfranchised - (no hard forks)\\n\\n\\n3. As many people as possible can verify from Genesis - (Blocks restricted to 1MB non Witness)\\n\\n\\n4. A highly restricted Blockchain size allows for the widest distribution of the *whole* ledger - (Blocks restricted to 1MB non Witness)\\n\\n\\n5. Individual blocks can be very easily transmitted across the whole internet even by satellite  - (Blocks restricted to 1MB non Witness)\\n\\n\\nThese are some very worthwhile properties and at the core of Maxi doctrine they also make BTC attractive to *VERY* large scale long term investors.\\n\\n\\n**The only problem is: This 1MB (non witness) Bitcoin leads to a custodial future for the masses** see [Pieter Wuille](https://twitter.com/pwuille/status/1186730172902301696) and [Tadge Dryja](https://youtu.be/LnG5H62I7Ko?t=1018) and pointed out to [Saifedean Ammous by Chris Pacia](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/mzjkkw/limitations_of_2nd_layers/gw3lhbs/)\\n\\n\\nThis is an outcome the less technical Maxi\\'s are unaware of. They believe the hype that the *Lightning Network* will save them though [Tadge Dryja - Co Inventor of the LN disagrees](https://youtu.be/LnG5H62I7Ko?t=1018)\\n\\n\\nAs for the more technical Maxi\\'s they have either given up on or never believed in *EVERYBODY HOLDING THEIR OWN KEYS*. **And they might be right!**  The one thing that gives me pause in my belief in BCH is: There are people (Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Matt Corallo...) who know far more about BTC than I do and have spent the past 10+ years thinking about it daily and they disagree with my outlook on Big Block Bitcoin.....\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAt one time I was deeply concerned that Bitcoin split.

You\\'ve been tipped for your post. u/chaintip - See who else has been tipped [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/rbtc-tipper/submitted/)It was more of a technical discussion instead of a debate back in 2010, ‚Äúdebate‚Äù started around 2014Um, well you can say that, and I have to presume it because I was just a kid that time.Well the link is quite helpful in getting a bit more knowledge, thanks for it.Fist confirm the year, I think there is the doubt taking the birth .The banger quotes won\\'t dirme so soon, they are making something inside.> So someone answer me, how could this have even become a debate?\\n\\nVery easily.\\n\\nIt\\'s all because people don\\'t think, they follow authorities and/or the rest of the herd instead.\\n\\nWhen you think about it, this is absolutely happening in different strength in all possible fields in all countries around the world everywhere, every discipline, because people cannot think rationally when there is possibility of social ostracism or being perceived as \"different\".\\n\\nIt\\'s not that people are stupid, no - this is not how it works. People want to stick to the others, to the herd, to the leader, they want to follow before all, so they **choose to reject logic and reason**, either consciously or subconsciously.\\n\\nCryptocurrency has helped me to understand the true nature of people. In the perception of the general population, whatever is being said by the alphas and/or the rest of the herd, is viewed as \"truth\" and whatever the alpha/the others say is a lie, is viewed as a lie.\\n\\nI didn\\'t always know it, but I always suspected that something is \"wrong\" with the world, since I was about 20. For many long years, I could not figure out completely what is going on, so I was angry. But after the events of past few years: CSW hash wars and later the ABC controversy, **it finally got to me:**.\\n\\n**People in general [the masses] do not follow logic, reason, wisdom, ideology or ethics. People follow only other people who claim to follow these things.** That is enough. Rest is irrelevant. No more explanations and common sense is required for the decision process.\\n\\nPeople have been behaving this way for all the known human history, this is a truth that explains everything that happened for the last 100.000 years of this civilization, including wars, genocides, communism and totalitarian states.\\n\\nThis is herd mentality, herd instinct. We are pack animals, last 200 years of industrialized society and last 30 years of semi-decentralized communication via Internet is not enough to remove traits that evolution has been building for the last what - 100 million years?\\n\\nTo not be part of the herd requires a huge effort, kind of acting against your deepest instincts. Acting against yourself. Against instinct of survival, which is probably the strongest instinct of all?\\n\\nPeople will prefer a visible leader, even a leader who is a lying son of a bitch who hurts them over a leaderless system every time and history has confirmed it countless times.\\n\\nThink about your life and about the lives of people around you. Why are the bad (and charismatic) guys often so popular in school? Why do the bad guys always \"get the girl\"?\\n\\nBecause an evolutionary instinct tells other people (especially girls) that a strong leader, even one that is exploiting them is a good thing. Because in the past, having a strong leader meant survival and having no leader / wandering leaderless without purpose meant certain death.\\n\\nNow, that I understand it deeply, having dealt with it, I have achieved peace. Nirvana of sorts.> how could this even become a debate\\n\\n lots of money to hire trolls, continually combing the forums, banning any signs of dissent.\\n\\nThe bitcoin community never chose small blocks.  In late 2013 & early 2014, the debate was a bout how do we raise it, and what do we raise it to.  And the 1MB limit was put in place by satoshi to avoid certain attacks that were only viable early in bitcoin\\'s life.\\n\\nThey started banning people in 2014, /r/btc and bitcoin.com were started to counter the censorship in 2016.  By 2017, /r/bitcoin was a toxic dump of maximalism.  It\\'s so bad that everyone in crypto complains about it, ie: bitcoin miami, but they don\\'t know how it got that bad.  It only got that bad because they agvressively banned anyone who wasn\\'t a toxic maxi.\\n\\nThe attitude trolls use comes off like that a-hole manager who knows what he\\'s doing, gets the store running smoothly again.  Cynicism is confused for confidence, and walls of text of long-debunked garbage is confused for facts.  So all new people from 2017 on got this maxi propaganda version of it.  And the comunity continued to sort for toxic maxi\\'s.\\n\\nThere ya go.  It happend artificially.  The community was way better in 2013.Well these things are seems like the history, and I am a bit week .Bitcoin cash is a shitcoin and a scamwhich is interesting because they say quoting this is worshiping satoshi.> inb4 something something religious text\\n\\nDamn it! And I was working on something... *Old Testment blah blah*\\n\\nSeriously though, Satoshi should\\'ve put that snippet in the source code or as pseudo-code in comments, making it a little harder to ignore.They have to said these words because it is just seems to be making the thing worse for them .Forks happen all the time, on accident as well. Anyone who has operated on the side of a pool owner knows it\\'s basically all stuck together with duck tape and faith. The idea that the only way to prevent the max amount of bitcoin from being printed is by never changing the code is ludicrous. Meanwhile we are creating fractional reserve bitcoin and making the argument on why we should never change the code because it will create fake bitcoin. The two arguments can\\'t be made together.BTC has hard-forked a number of times in the past, mate. Try run a 2010 node, it won‚Äôt sync.

Genuinely curious because all I\\'ve ever done or seen is using usdt as a bridge between cryptos. \\n\\n At most people hold it for months, after taking profits, but they buy back into crypto eventually anyway. Or sell it for non usd currencies in binance p2p for example. If that\\'s most of the use of usdt then tether wouldn\\'t even need 100% reserves in a scenario where people are cashing out. And a lot would just convert usdt to other cryptos (including stable coins) no?Bro you are really crazy, it‚Äôs true that a lie can run for a while, but eventually it breaks down, and if they get hacked or people start exchanging USDTs for their USDs shit‚Äôll get pretty wild. The elite are the only ones who doesn‚Äôt get affected by things like this, like the USDs, backed by the ‚Äútrust‚Äù on the US govt, or better said, by the trust on the power of the american elite.I think they call this delusion Modern Monetary Theory, or MMT for short.IMO govt has FED to print all the money, so they have no interest in USDT in that regard. But ability to operate fraudulently for such a long time implies there\\'s a massive amount of corruption involved. Otherwise why would NY attorney general just stopped with the wrist-slap fine, while they could take down a 70billion dollar ponzi?>The only logical reason why isn\\'t US govt shutting down Tether yet is that they are involved in it themselves.\\n\\n100% this.\\n\\nIn my country the corruption reigns, but the government does not give a damn. Why? Because they themselves are the manifestation of corruption!\\n\\nIn the same way, how the hell do the U.S. with that behemoth of surveillance act like retards against tether?! Well, they are a part of it!> With such assumption, everything starts to makes sense. \\n\\nNo, no it doesn\\'t wtf, man.\\n\\nWe all need to stay away from tether because it seems doomed to implode either thorough criminal charges or a bank run; but just throwing around random lizard people accusations doesn\\'t help us understand what\\'s going on or why they\\'re toxic. This government implication is effing ridiculous.\\n\\nLet\\'s keep our thinking hats on for this one, ey?>The only logical reason why isn\\'t US govt shutting down Tether yet is that they are involved in it themselves.\\n\\n100% agreeTether is being used to pump btc and short Bitcoin Cash.I think so, there really isn\\'t any reason to hold USDT unless people are using it to earn interests, or maybe they are worried that crypto prices will go down but doesn\\'t want to withdraw and deposit again later because of fees and therefore exchange their crypto into USDT.Does the company behind USDT exchange USDT for $?I‚Äôm not sure why anyone downvoted this. The fractional reserve system they use in the US (and many other countries) is the same way. No bank has anywhere near enough to cover the deposits if everyone asked for their money back>govt has FED to print all the money, so they have no interest in USDT in that regard\\n\\nThere is no digital dollar though. Well, at least not until USDT is deemed \"too big to fail\" and brought under the auspices of the Fed....> No, no it doesn\\'t wtf, man.\\n\\nOf course it does.\\n\\nIf US government is supporting Finex/Tether and Tether is a cancerous tumor on Bitcoin and Crypto, through supporting Tether they are attacking Bitcoin(Cash).\\n\\nThis is an absolutely rational and logical thing to do for them. In fact so rational, it **almost makes no sense not to do it**.\\n\\n> just throwing around random lizard people accusations\\n\\nThis is a strawman, also a \"you are a conspiracy theorist\" attack.\\n\\nNot very nice.\\n\\nThe theory I have given is very plausible considering the circumstances.\\n\\nAlso, considering that **many of popular conspiracy theories of 2000s are turning out to be real right now**, I would say that you are only giving more credibility to what I say.Yes I\\'m sure that the same people who sold arms to Iran in order to fund a coup in Nicaragua will just sit on their hands and silently cry in despair as the Almighty Petrodollar is replaced by a borderless decentralized currency because to do otherwise might be unethical.Issue a digital USD while deliberately and flagrantly avoiding US jurisdiction. See how long before someone knocks on your door.> This is a strawman, also a \"you are a conspiracy theorist\" attack.\\n\\n\"And my proof is that I think it makes sense, that Snowden showed something that wasn\\'t very conspiratorial but merely a power overreach over the legal framework that had been moving in that direction anyways, and that everybody believes I\\'m nuts\".\\n\\nNo man. I not trying to be disrespectful, but you must understand that conspiracy theories need even a shred of evidence. The DoJ actually investigating Tether is the complete opposite of evidence, but I\\'m sure you\\'ll turn it into the opposite (\"is a false flag man! Wake up!\").\\n\\nDo you also believe by any chance the government had something to gain from the coronavirus, and that they\\'re lying and suppressing real treatments for their gain?I\\'m honestly surprised to see this sub becoming this over time, but I can\\'t say I haven\\'t seen the warning signs. Back in 15.

And it doesn\\'t happen. Something must be up with your \"logic\".> No man. I not trying to be disrespectful, but you must understand that conspiracy theories need even a shred of evidence.\\n\\nI never said that it is certain or that there is evidence.\\n\\nI said, quote:\\n\\n> The only **logical** reason why isn\\'t US govt shutting down Tether yet is that they are involved in it themselves.\\n\\nWhich implies (\"logical\") that it is just a theory, one of many possible scenarios.\\n\\nA very plausible and reasonable one, still.There\\'s only one way in an ostensibly free market to \"kill Bitcoin,\" and that\\'s to render it harmless and yet popular, so that people don\\'t latch on to something more harmful.\\n\\nI don\\'t think you need to resort to ad hominem to make your point, just provide better logic than I\\'m using.> Which implies (\"logical\") that it is just a theory, one of many possible scenarios.\\n\\nNo, that\\'s not what you said, as per your own quote, but emphasis mine:\\n\\n>> **The only** logical reason why isn\\'t US govt shutting down Tether yet is that they are involved in it themselves.\\n\\nAnd this is insane. It\\'s not the only reason. Another (and far more logical, despite what you believe), is that the US, for all its faults is still a Rule of Law state, which means that a thorough investigation needs to occur before they can be charged, and subsequently condemned, in order to shut them down. \\n\\nI brought up the coronavirus matter, because this is exactly the kind of faulty \"logical\" thinking that leads people down  Qanon and related rabbit holes. It\\'s a never ending cycle of justification, confirmation biases, failure to incorporate new factual information, and just plain old lack of imagination.\\n\\nAs I said to Jessquit, I actually was with you guys back in \\'15; but over the last especially 2 years the theorisation has deviated more from rationality towards.... this.\\n\\nTo be clear; I definitely believe Tether is engaging in fractional reserving, and absolutely think there\\'s solid evidence to understand the price of bitcoin during its rallies being propped up from it. But that\\'s as far as the discernible evidence goes, and to implicate the US government in it \"to supress the freedoms of cryptos\" is just.... well, completely unsubstantiated, let\\'s leave it at that. Despite all that you believe, all of crypto is embedding itself slowly but surely into the mainstream financial sector.> The only logical reason why isn\\'t US govt shutting down Tether yet is that they are involved in it themselves.\\n\\n**No there isn\\'t**. And I\\'m surprised I need to point this out. Your read on the situation isn\\'t only *not* the only possible read; but also doesn\\'t constitute evidence of anything.\\n\\n> I don\\'t think you need to resort to ad hominem to make your point, \\n\\nI\\'m not resorting to an ad-hominem; merely lamenting the frequency with which these unsubstantiated claims make an appearance on this sub. It seemingly has stopped being about growing crypto and BCH in particular, but about finding monsters in everyone\\'s atticks.\\n\\n> just provide better logic than I\\'m using.\\n\\nThe problem is just that this is not the burden of proof works. I don\\'t need to come up with evidence to dispute a completely unsourced (and unimaginative at that) claim. I just need to point out that it is, and ask for everyone to reconsider.> And this is insane.

Further, I am glad he sold out because now I can use Litecoin without worrying about the founder selling his huge stake because it is already done, so now LTC is a more acceptable option than it used to be. That being said, if Charlie started another coin with a Litecoin-like premine, I would expect him to do the same, sell out at an ATH, so I would not use that coin at least until that had already happened. This is why I don\\'t like coins with premines but I don\\'t consider it to be much of a question of ethics, merely wise investment.

Say it ain\\'t so, BCH crowd! Who\\'s gonna explain this one away?Maybe tommy lee selling all of his shares was him signaling that he wants no part in the shenanigans going on. He said he sold because it was a conflict of interest. I checked him out recently and he is on about fungability, which to me shows he has the right mindset.

Not a good thing.\\n\\nThe only thing I have ever heard about Charlie Lee that made me dislike him personally is when I heard he reneged on a bet with Roger. But when Roger posted about that recently, Charlie replied offering to resolve the situation amicably by letting an independent party adjudicate who won the bet, and Roger entirely ignored his overture, which surprised me, so I am not really sure I should be too angry with Charlie about that bet, either. It was a fair gesture toward resolving the disagreement on Charlie\\'s part and yet Roger didn\\'t seem interested in resolving it fairly at all. Possibly he just didn\\'t see the offer. Maybe he had too many notifications or has Charlie blocked?Absolutely, that\\'s possible.Well, it doesn\\'t apply here. Monero mixes inputs to hide the true sender and receiver.

Seriously? It increased the block size, wow, what a revolution.\\n\\nBitcoin cash is going into irrelevance, all it takes is for bitcoin to increase its block size to completely kill bitcoin cash.I am not a holder you dummy.> Bitcoin cash is going into irrelevance\\n\\nOn the contrary, almost every time I see a shortlist of three to five coins being adopted these days, Bitcoin Cash is on it. That wasn\\'t the case, say, a year ago. And this effect has persisted and gotten stronger despite BCH (along with many others) sliding down the price charts as new contenders have seized stronger positions. But those new contenders are largely missing from the adoption shortlists. I conclude that position on the price charts is fairly meaningless and adoptability is everything. BCH has maintained Bitcoin\\'s original adoptability, and this is something that BTC and even LTC, which foolishly also saddled itself with SegWit, have lost. This advantage has been paying off in BCH\\'s persistent membership in budding crypto multiplexes. \\n\\n> all it takes is for bitcoin to increase its block size to completely kill bitcoin cash.\\n\\nNot true at all. Bitcoin would have to adopt a lot of technologies that are anathema to its current design, like CTOR/Graphene, and other scale-ready optimisations that BCH software engineers have added, and are slated to continue to add, over the years, for example on BCH\\'s ongoing experimental [scalenet](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/j66eh8/scalenet_and_testnet4_are_online_and_open_for/). Of course this being free and open source software, if BTC developers ever do eat crow and start copycatting BCH\\'s development path (which by the way would put BCH developers in the pole position), BTC could borrow and benefit from the results of those experiments -- but not the experience BCH developers are acquiring in doing them. The BTC side would be playing \\'catch up\\' for years if not decades, depending on how late they decide to \\'pivot\\'.Reddit is now censoring links in comments to bitcointalk.org (top-level posts can still be linked).\\n\\n**This means that if you post links in comments to any of Satoshi\\'s original discussion board posts, they\\'re going to get removed by reddit.**  The mods here can (and will) manually approve these comments, but please be aware there could be a significant delay since these must be manually approved (we can\\'t automate the comment approval with the automod script, only the approval of top-level-posts, not sure why).\\n\\nA conversation with Reddit admins reveals that their justification for this ban is that the site was \"associated with malicious activity.\"  That is all the admins will say on the issue.\\n\\n\\\\_sad\\\\_pikachu\\\\_dot\\\\_gif\\\\_Hey Reddit, this isn\\'t why Aaron invented you.Would it make sense to have a sticky with all the domains that are censored so people are aware of them?Link to all of Satoshis writings in one place.     \\nhttps://www.np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/l17tgn/everything_satoshi_wrote_kicking_the_hornets_nest\"associated with malicious activity\"\\n\\nGuess reddit must be banned, too.I will attempt to copy the contents of the forum to preserve for historical value, as I am seeing a danger now.

These things don\\'t happen spontaneously or because the admins wake up one day and decide they suddenly don\\'t like historically important forums. They happen because of concerted censorship campaigns (hitting report on links, writing complaints using formal processes, filling in abuse forms, etc) aimed by cultists at the most clueless, kneejerk censors. So which cult is responsible for this one? Would prefer persuasive evidence over simple speculating.Reddit have became same like facebook ,instagram etc.Reddit is a cesspool of censorship.Reddit isn\\'t what it use to be.  To much censored information.Can you link to an archive.org link that archives the page you want to post, or will it block that as well?TBF it\\'s not hard to see why they would say this, various scripts and such for sale there that are clearly geared towards illegal use etc.. plenty of good reason for this to of happened IMHO.Fuck Reddit, but also fuck Bitcointalk. Bitcointalk banned me for \"plagiarizing\" from a post I made on my OWN reddit account. How can I plagiarize myself? That\\'s an oxymoron.\\n\\nWe all know Reddit is ran by a bunch of lefty dictators, and have a pattern of running their site to fit their agenda. However, I think Reddit is actually pro-crypto (see their moons initiative), so it might not be as sinister of reason behind censoring it. I\\'ll give them the benefit of the doubt until I hear their reasoning. There could have been a legitimate reason behind it.I\\'m against censorship but in this case, not much of value is lost. The bitcointalk forum is as valuable as r bitcoin. No surprise because both are controlled by scumbag theymos.I\\'ll bet they allow links to pornography, though.

Why? \\n\\nThe top trading pair for BCH on almost every exchange is Tether.wrong, for that sum of money they must have KYC ,as per as I know.Interessting question.

But i think my point is still right. Most rich people know how the count and care about fee... Probability as a matter of principle rather than needs.BTC\\'s trading volume with Tether runs 100X higher than BCH, in proportion to the price difference. So BTC has been pumped 100X more by Tether, which makes sense, and means its price gets far more artificially inflated than BCH\\'s every time Tether\\'s magic money printer goes \\'brrrr\\'.Sweetheart, because BTC needs to be pumped by Tether and Tether needs BTC.

Otherwise, BTC has no use case. \\n\\nBitcoin Cash can survive without Tether like Bitcoin in its early days: being used as P2P electronic Cash üòòNo, they gave a deadline for existing customers to leave without kycBinance doesn\\'t operate in NY and the investigation into tether is over.

Or is there that economist who thinks so?Nah not in the circulation one but the one moving the circulation market.Bitcoin is the flagship. If Bitcoin can fail, then any currency can. At least in the minds of the people. \"Do I need to constantly check for newer, more innovative currencies that could replace mine\" will be the commonly asked question. Thats antithetical to security and invested funds. Cycles will quickly accelarate, and currencies will descend into hypervolatility and finally irrelevance. The least bumpy road - and the one I wish for - is that bitcoin becomes the crypto gold like the maxis want it to. After it has firmly established itself, it will have shoehorned in all the other currencies that are truly decentralized and here to stay.Not in the long term either unless a currency can sucessfully pull of the narrative shift of having been the real bitcoin \"all along\". BCH is the only currency that can do that, and its still a major risk.Yes, this is my personal opinion.This is nonsense.  If crypto is useful, then it will be demanded regardless of what BS the financial systems apply to it.  Bitcoin may be like what you describe, but that is because the leaders have decided that it should be useless, and thus arbitrarily derive its value.  Time will show that successful cryptos are useful to the common man, and thus will be demanded perpetually, driving their value.I agree with that.What use do I have in crypto if it only becomes hip after my lifetime? Very long-term, maybe (Not everything useful is implemented) But short-term (10 years) a loss of trust would be devastating.Why do you agree with this?[We have doubts about the legitimacy of Tether, so today we announce the Hindenburg Tether Bounty Program, a reward of up to $1,000,000 for details on Tether‚Äôs backing.](https://twitter.com/HindenburgRes/status/1450562260993298433?s=20)This is great, Hindenburg is legit, check out their track record on the ‚ÄúAbout Us‚Äù page.Someone really needs to make a meme of the Hinderburg running into a Tether T, thus explaining the reasoning behind this lol\\n\\nedit: also, a John Wick meme fits as wellJokes on us Tether doesn\\'t have any backing.Uh holy shit!\\n\\nEdit: Who has 1m sitting there to fund such things btw?The only people who know the details are insiders who gain more than $1m by not telling.Earlier references: https://tether.to/latest-assurance-opinion-confirms-tether-fully-backed/\\n\\nTether issued loans against collateral not denominated in usd, or even \"commercial paper\", but crypto itself: https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/10/07/tether-has-lent-1b-to-celsius-network-report/Do they pay in USDT?

That said, it doesn\\'t take a million dollar investigation to understand the violation of economic principles at play in a token that is managed by people who arbitrarily inflate the supply.This makes my mouth water, juicy.DRW Cumberland and FTX are pegging USDT for as long as they see fit for Tether to exist.\\n\\nThe same could be true of other tokens and even chains.\\n\\nControlling a ponzi vicariously isn\\'t illegal. $1M dollery-dos isn\\'t going to stop them.\\n\\nThey have already positioned a successor.\\n\\nAlso, Hindenburg Research should offer real money next time (in a real currency).\\n\\nEdit: specify Hindenburg ResearchNathan Anderson said: ‚ÄúWe feel strongly that Tether should fully and thoroughly disclose its holdings to the public.

He probably isn\\'t going to pay.\\n1. The info is worth many millions.I don\\'t know about that.  There could be some Chinese companies involved that could use the money right about now.You guys are not serious with this timing. I agree, tether is a scam, but you are not doing your credibility any favors dropping this as BTC is pushing ATH.Tether is backed by btc, and the price of btc is determined by how many tethers are being paid to buy it. No way this could go wrong!If you accept USDT, then the bounty is increased to 100 million. Aww shit, make it a billion.It can\\'t be sustained forever though, especially not when margin calls are automated.Nobody likes big short seller firms, but it\\'s a really important job. You dont want bulls singing until it crashes like Enron. I think they did a great job with Clover, undressing Chamath Palihapitiya, the greatest snake oil salesman.They should be able to make money off their research. They exposed the fact that Nikola faked having a working truck by filming a truck rolling down a hill with a tilted camera.There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with shorting, if a business has proven to be a scam I see no problem with it. We‚Äôll have to wait if anyone comes forward with convincing information. Hindenburg will certainly publish that report if it contains anything worth looking at (after they have entered their position obviously).smart. So basically they pay 1m for information worth 70 Billion.It\\'s their venture to risk. I see no problem with profiting from the publication of information.\\n\\nIn any case, they\\'ve shown their hand.

Kind of in their name.

What actually happens is that your position is closed and you lose your deposit. Behind the scenes, someone who is theoretically long the asset actually only holds an IOU (the asset has been borrowed and then sold) but there is potentially not enough money to repurchase the asset if its price increases enough. I don\\'t know how clearly this is explained to the long at his time of purchase.I think what you are describing is actually regular short selling, naked short selling (which is illegal in most countries) doesn‚Äôt involve borrowing the shares and then selling them. Which is what Citadel is accused of by a lot of people buy GameStop right now. They are convinced more shares were shorted than available and are trying to force a short squeeze which could send GME sky high simply because not enough shares exists to cover those naked shorts.\\nHindenburg doesn‚Äôt have to resort to those illegal practices, buying puts, selling calls or outright selling BTC futures contracts are considered net short positions as well.Thanks!Cool Infographic!  \\n(shouldnt it be saying: trustless instead of trusted?)Great infographic.

If they want to move their store of value, they need to know which block will have the cheapest fee, or else they\\'re losing more than they wanted to sell.Maybe, but you miss the point. Is the next block fee _slow and unreliable_?\\n\\nNo, it\\'s _the next block fee_ so therefore it should be _fast_ and _reliable_, right?\\n\\nYou want potentially slow or unreliable, try the 9c fee, for many use cases that\\'s fine.You\\'re right that the first question should be no and the second one should be as fast and reliable. The fact that BTC\\'s answers to those are flat \"maybe\" because BTC rush hours cause high fees on themselves alone.\\n\\n0-conf transactions are no longer practical in BTC due to RBF, and using RBF means anyone trying to be safe needs to have one confirmation.\\n\\nThe average fee doesn\\'t matter when you want to go to the next block, and everyone wants to get the first block available so they can do their things immediately.True, having a limited resource creates some unique problems. I just find it sleazy that bitcoin.com pump out these misleading infographics constantly. They can\\'t promote bch without attacking bitcoin, yet are the ones complaining when real bitcoiners turn up and call them out on their shit \\n\\nChoosing to send/accept RBF enabled spends, or accept a zero conf payment is a choice. Same as accepting coins or notes which could be counterfeit, or card payments that can be reversed.\\n\\nWhenever you need to make a payment within _x_  minutes has always been a problem, because there\\'s no guarantee when the next block is going to be mined. Of course it\\'s risky to let someone leave your store if the transaction is not confirmed, 0 conf was never seen as safe, even Satoshi acknowledged that.\\n\\nBecause of unpredictable block times, I don\\'t think bitcoin (or bch) \"on chain\"  is a good way to pay \"instantly\" for anything, it really is a settlement layer, and worrying over next block fees isn\\'t something the end user should be thinking about. The UX should be separate, but no less secure, than the base layer.Holy Greg brigade batman.That\\'s all the endorsment you need, no?100%100%Perhaps I\\'m mistaken but...\\n\\nWhy does it seem that Gavin isn\\'t active anymore in the peer to peer electronic cash scene?**This.**Wow.

Hardly a store of value. If bcash cannot store value, there is little point in exchanging it.A means of exchange... until the 8mb are full. For scaling you need to be smarter than that. Postponing full blocks by a year or so is not scaling.0.01BTC\"means of exchange\" exactly\\nI not agree with this one, ive heard it before. Its forked in 2017 so its started at 2017! Bitcoin started at 2009. BCH from 2017, otherwise it was like 60K right now.To me its one of the best Coins, the one with the best options, but people dont see it or dont wanna see it unfortunately. Its a long difficult road, and im wondering if we ever gonna get mass adoption.I think we lost the game. I hear many people it will hit 4/5k at the end of the year, but even if that happen ( which I dont think) they are still the big gamblers.

That is why a BTC crash, crashes the Tether prices of altcoins.If Tether collapses, the bulk of corruption, deceit and censorship will be removed from crypto.

The 2nd most is litecoin.  BTC is on every exchange.  Its the backbone of the crypto economy.  It has the most trading pairs.  BTC also has some of the most talented and knowledgeable cryptographers and developers working on its code (over 300+ contributors).  There are several exchanges that directly fund certain developers.   While some may not like it\\'s small blocksize,  it\\'s there to protect against centralization.  Anyone can run a node on the bitcoin network, but that becomes more difficult to do with large block sizes.  BTC has the lightening network, which provided near fee-less and instant transactions in a non custodial way (there are custodial solutions too).  On the main chain BTC can cost a lot to send a transaction, sometimes quite high like 10-20$.  However that is rare.  Most transactions during this bull run have been for under 50 cents.  I have sent a lot lately for even under 10 cents. However when the bull run gets heated, it does cost more, especially if you want to get in the next block.  You can find an honest and accurate fee estimator at mempool.space  (don\\'t use BCH sponsored fee sites as they will purposely inflate the numbers by confusing you with terms.  Most transactions are 240-400 bytes, like the average single user transaction, but these sites will say median transaction or whatever to conflate an average users transactions with those of exchanges, which are very complex and rightfully cost more because they take up more space).  Bitcoin also has the advantage of increasing in value a lot more than BCH.  In fact if you look at the BCH to BTC ratio, its at or near all time lows (that means the value of BTC in reference to BCH is sliding down hill.  right now 1 BCH is worth .0097 BTC.  Its all time low was near .008 BTC.  It once was valued at almost .20 !  SO that means people are consistently over time valuing BTC more.   [BCH/BTC ratio ](https://www.bitcoinwisdom.io/markets/gdax/bchbtc?s)\\n\\nBitcoin cash has the advantage of not having such high fees so you can get a transaction in the next block for a penny (or less).  \\nI think thats BCH main advantage, so if you need a crypto to transact with a lot, like 100\\'s of time daily, then maybe BCH is your guy.  However, you can use the lightening network to transact with for low fees, but I don\\'t think the lightening network is as accepted as BCH.  I mean there are places like Bitrefill (buying gift cards and cell phone minutes) that only accept BTC and lightening.  \\nSo you should determine your needs.  \\nWhile its very rare nfor me to spend anything else but BTC, I do keep a small amount of BCH and litecoin for when I need to make a transaction during the times when BTC has high fees.   That has only happened once for me.  I would say I make like 10-15 transactions a month.   For instance, I buy my cellphone minutes sometimes with BTC.  the cost is 10$ per month. I wouldnt want to buy cellphone minutes when the fees are high because spending 2 or 3 $ on a 10$ transaction is not something I want to do.  Luckily the place where I buy my cellphone minutes also uses lightening.  I keep my wealth in BTC because I enjoy the gains but I also am on board with the way they have chosen to scale.Bitcoin forked, bitcoin became BTC and BCH (BCH has forked too) \\n\\nBCH is Bitcoin with a higher transaction limit and smaller network effect. \\n\\nBTC is Bitcoin limited to 1MB of transactions data it has a lager network effect (and a higher price)You would do much better to put you money into BTC and ETH before you place it into BCH. BCH is getting left behind as far as adoption... that\\'s all you really need to know to answer this question.Here is [why BCH](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH/why-bitcoin-cash) and here is the counterarguments [why BTC](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqs/BCH/why-not-bitcoin-cash), since the reasons against BCH are basically the reasons for BTC - the things they share the reasons they will beat fiat.I am still here trying to sort out the game behind this all and what I have in my mind is just ash.Hedging is smart. BCH has the potential and BTC has the current momentum. I also own bothBitcoin cash (BCH) is well ahead of bitcoin in terms of transaction speed (BTC). Furthermore, it expedites the confirmation of your transaction. Bitcoin cash, on the other hand, has lower average transaction fees than bitcoin. Bitcoin is having difficulty meeting demand due to its high transaction fees.Btc is mostly bought by morons. There are a lot of them.The main advantages:\\n\\nBrand, first to market, largest market cap, king of crypto.> I don\\'t love BTC but I do love seeing success in the crypto space.

BCH is the best p2p cash, XMR is the 2nd best, then BTC (more expensive and slower, but well-recognized), then LTC, then ETH and just a handful more\\n\\nSuccess of LN may undermine BTC, thoughTo be clear, BCH is exactly as old as BTC. Both ledgers start at the genesis block.Except it literally has never been higher. So you meant you sold it when it was low. Whoops.You did great in buying but you did worse in selling all of it, if you think the way I am.Thanks.\\nI originally got into crypto because the idea of peer to peer decentralized deflationary cash was exciting for me. Right now, BCH scratches that itch, but ultimately it doesnt really matter which coin \"succeeds\" as long as crypto as a whole succeeds enough.\\n\\nI also think that most merchants end up accepting more than one coin anyways. Once they get past the big hurdle of accepting one crypto currency, the next one is much easier.

There\\'s a reason why places like Amazon and Facebook are trying to develop their own digital currencies. \\n\\nThere\\'s also some political pressure to moving to crypto: in light-gray market areas, they can charge as much as 10-15% and sometimes decide to nope out completely. The censorship resistance and pseudo-privacy of crypto is already a driving force and will become more and more important in the future.Fuck you fiat shill.\\n\\npaypal is notorious for locking up user funds and blacklisting businesses based on politics.\\n\\nFUCK YOU.You don\\'t even know what this is, do you:\\n\\nhttps://blockchair.com/bitcoin/charts/average-transaction-fee-usd>\\tSuccess of LN may undermine BTC, though\\n\\nSo far LN has not been particularly spectacular.>  but ticking like a clock. BCH is the best p2p cash, XMR is the 2nd best, then BTC (more expensive and slower, but well-recognized), then LTC, then ETH and just a handful more\\n\\nBTC, ETH and LTC are not p2p money.\\n\\nDYOR, idiot.Oh no Bitcoin is alive and vibrant it just broke ATH, maybe you missed the newsLol.... i love the predictable market psychology. Never fails.***\\nu/gotamd, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay236njcae3watkcu6ufzh9m0c0rpywftmjgq7) `0.0001311 BCH` | `~0.08 USD` by u/don2468\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***>It is not out of the question to raise the blocksize.\\n\\nThat is a very viable option, I hold my BTC and never cashed out fully to BCH and BSV because that remains an option. There are caveats though, Some developers are talking about raising the 21M limit to pay miners, and the BTC Core fundamentalists lose credibility when they do admit they were wrong. Many of them already say there is no blcoksize limit because the segregated portion of the chain is not limited. \\n\\nThere is another aspect to the scaling of-chain with SPV wallets, some of the technologies were never developed for BTC, BTC Core developers said it was impossible. The ABC developers didn\\'t like the idea so they forked off BSV, it\\'s quite possible that nChain and CSW have IP that allows true SPV scaling so even if BCH and BTC copy them, they\\'ll need to license the tech from BSV. (most BTC and BCH fundamentalists thing CSW is a fraud and his 1000\\'s of patents are worth nothing.)  \\n\\n> the 1mb blocks are not locked in forever.\\n\\nthe 1MB limit was a soft fork, the Core Minimalists said it can\\'t be changed because then the nodes that dont upgrade won\\'t be able to validate a block. BU fixed that problem. But Core refused. So when they admit their frivolous reason is nonsense and people all agree it can change. But until then people may just adopt the fork that never made a mistake. \\n\\n>Also there have been scaling improvements like segwit and taproot that have added the number of transactions per second that the network can do.\\n\\nYes, but too little too late. Those are marginal improvements. \\n\\nI remain cautiously optimistic, and invested in all possible outcomes.The most convincing thing you could do to demonstrate that is stop posting here.\\n\\nBut you don\\'t, you come back day after day after day.  So clearly hope is not futile, because even you still want to be involved.I\\'m in this space because I agree. But I don\\'t think average people care about sound money until they\\'re personally affected by hyper inflation. People care about inflation as a concept but I don\\'t think the slow burn of inflation is enough of an incentive to get average non tech people to jump through the hoops and hurdles to buy and use crypto. Especially because of how many scams and rug pulls are in this space. I think crypto has immediate appeal in much of the developing world.For sure if there\\'s a crypto discount, that would incentivize the average Joe to consider using crypto. Agreed. But without that, the average guy in a first world country has no real need for crypto when cashapp and PayPal already provide free instant transactions for the consumer and you don\\'t have to worry about losing anything. If the discount isn\\'t passed along to the consumer, he doesn\\'t care about the merchants fees. So convincing consumers to actually use crypto is a tough sell, unless they already experience hardships with transactions because of high fee remittances or a hyperinflated currency.Age of encryption? It looks like the regulatory scape is shaping to ban/permission encryption, though.\\n\\nAnd btw: nothing in a cryptocurrency is actually encrypted. The \"crypto\" refers to cryptography, not encryption.I don\\'t disagree with the problems with PayPal. (Even though fiat shill seems a bit over the top lol). But I think an average person in a first world developed country doesn\\'t have any experience with that and so there\\'s no incentive for them to use crypto if they\\'ve never been affected negatively. In my own personal circles/experience, cashapp, Zelle, Venmo and Paypal is used a lot and the end user/consumer gets the experience of a no fee instant transaction. So for someone happy to use cashapp, convincing them to use crypto is a very hard sell. The only appealing thing is the hope to get rich.You don\\'t even know what I\\'m talking about, do you.  It seems like you don\\'t but allow me to re-explain the point I am trying to make because you seem to not understand.   I couldn\\'t get any info on how that calculate that metric, but that metric likely includes transactions from exchanges.  Which are very large and complex.  Those cost a lot more.  people shouldn\\'t be using that metric to gauge what they spend, should they?  or should they use mempool.space, which uses the size of a transaction that most end users would have?  Say there is a block where only large and complex transactions were included,  they paid 10 sats per vbyte, but the transactions were 20,000 or 50000 vbytes (125$ t0 300$)  The average transaction fee would be really high.  But if a block only included simple transactions, say 1 input 2 outputs, those transactions would only be 140-300 vbytes.  at 10 sats per vbyte that would till be around dollar or so.  So the average transaction fee would be a lot lower even though the sat per vbyte was the same.  \\nSO do you understand why \"average transaction fee\" is disingenuous?  It shouldn\\'t be average transaction fee in terms of dollar,  it should be in terms of sat per vbyte (with notes on how big a normal input 2 outputs transaction is) \\nIf an exchange pays a fee of 100$ for a transaction and I pay 10 cents,  the average transaction fee is going to not give me an idea what most end users are paying. \\n But most of the time u/Egon_1 and people like yourself are posting https://bitcoinfees.cash/ which right now says you should spend 1,73 when mempool.space is saying 1 sat per byte, so 8 cents\\nThe most honest metric would be an average of sat per bytes it cost.  They then could just use that and have a note that a simple BTC transactions costs  X amount (based on the 250-400 bytes that an simple end user transaction is)\\nEDIT:  changed bytes to vbytes. My calculations assume people are using segwit\\nBut instead BCH adherents around here like to post confusing metrics and disingenuous websites (like https://bitcoinfees.cash/).  BTC fees are not cheap, so there is no reason to make such exaggerated claims.> Oh no Bitcoin is alive and vibrant it just broke ATH, maybe you missed the news\\n\\nActually, you missed the memo. BTC is not \"Bitcoin\", it stopped being that in 2017.If some miners were to increase the total amount of bitcoin above the 21mill limit, it would just cause a fork and birth another shitcoin.  The same way that a tiny amount of miners increased the mempool limit, which caused a fork, and birthed the shitcoin (s) known as Bitcoin ABC+SV.banned from r/bitcoin, using r/btc is not an endorsement of BCH per se. BCH is fine... but I just have to point out that it is not Bitcoin, and won\\'t ever be Bitcoin. Similar, yes... that\\'s how forks work.This sub is literally called \"btc\" not bch or bitcoincash. Stop pretending that BCH is the same as bitcoin. BCH started in 2017, period. That\\'s just facts.There are plenty of people who got their PayPal accounts frozen for months. Though most of the time they sent a friend some money, or made a private sale to someone over Ebay and the like.\\n\\nPayPal is a total nightmare for sellers.\\n\\nPurely as a buyer I also like to use it of course, as it\\'s super simple for me. But I\\'d never use it as a merchant, ever.\\n\\nI\\'d say first we get merchants on board, they already save on a ton of fees. Then they can always give discounts to get more people to pay in BCH.Sorry, you are either realistic about the nature of the fiat system, or you can fuck off from here.Is that why bch just dropped below 1% of btc for the first time?Sorry the real Bitcoin doesn\\'t get outcompeted by coins like Doge and ShibABC cased the BSV fork by making arbitrary protocol rule changes that the majority of BCH miners did not support. The community bought into ABC\\'s first fork but not the second. the fork occurred for many reasons, among them Roger buying over $1,000,000 of rented horsepower to push through the ABC changes. \\n\\nre the 21M cap, I was just saying the 21M limit increase is only slightly less attractive than keeping the 1MB limit for ever. \\n\\nWhen the difficulty chain death occurs as a result of a halving, no fees and a panic crash, Core will step in and save the day with a solution. It won\\'t cause a split because there will be not viable reason to mine BTC at a new difficulty when there are no fees or rewards. \\n\\nAll miners will try to RoI by mining the new profitable chain and abandon the one that does not pay.Bitcoin Core is not Bitcoin.  \\n\\n\\nü§îIf that is the case, how did we time travel back to 2009 in order to put transactions into our blockchain before it existed?\\n\\nI\\'d be worried if I was trying to compete against an entire community of time travellers.> Sorry the real Bitcoin doesn\\'t get outcompeted by coins like Doge and Shib\\n\\nDoge, Shib and BTC all together belong in the compost bin.\\n\\n1 is a shitcoin and 2 are joke coins of which authors don\\'t even know what they are doing.Agree.. Bitcoin is Bitcoin (BTC).Because its a fork lol\\n\\nThats such a poor \"gotcha\" even by this sub\\'s standards.Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin.Exactly.  Just like BTC.  The original Bitcoin split in a Y shape, and now there are two competing versions.\\n\\nIf you think BTC has more of a claim to the idea just because it got the branding, then your level of reasoning is pretty poor.  If the US government renamed the US dollar to Bitcoin, would it BE Bitcoin? Of course not.  Labels are ephemeral, but ideas are eternal.No, it didnt split in a Y shape. That\\'s a lie, BCH was forked off of BTC.Where is the lie?  That is literally how a cryptocurrency fork works.  If you don\\'t understand that, bamboozled by the current brand names, that\\'s your lack of understanding not a factual mistake.\\n\\nIf it helps, imagine history had played out differently and the names were reversed.  BCH was called Bitcoin and BTC was called Bitcoin Core.  Would you be here telling me BTC \"forked off\" of BCH?  If you wouldn\\'t, then your own logic is a fail.  And if you would, then your only criteria to deciding which one was the \"continuation\" is the brand name, which is clearly decided by people AFTER the fork it\\'s nothing inherent about one side of the chain or the other, at the time of the split it is a Y split.Sorry you are the one who doesnt understand how software works. After a fork, one is the main branch the other is the forked branch. \\n\\nThats literally how all software versioning works. \\n\\nNow that is different than how fork is used colloquially, but in this case it was more of the standard fork rather than a Y fork. \\n\\nCome back when you understand a little about software.\\n\\nPS: theres no such thing a \"bitcoin core\". Theres bitcoin and theres bitcoin cash.> Sorry you are the one who doesnt understand how software works. After a fork, one is the main branch the other is the forked branch. \\n\\n> Thats literally how all software versioning works. \\n\\nOh I get it. You think a blockchain fork === software fork (ah, see, I am a programmer too). You\\'re correct.... about software.  And you think that\\'s how this works, even though it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nA blockchain fork is not a code fork.  Yes, there was a fork for the node software, but there didn\\'t need to be.  I could code a new Bitcoin node implementation today in a programming language that syncd up to the BTC or BCH chain, and then at a later point split the blockchain.  And neither node software would have any relation to the other as a code fork.  It could even be two new node softwares coded up, syncd to the chain, then the original code got unpopular and people switched into the two new node softwares, then a fork happened.  And this fork is happening on a blockchain which the original node code is no longer related to at all or running on.\\n\\nCode forks !== blockchain forks, so you need to divorce those concepts in your mind (although they have similarities) before you can understand this.12354Alright, well how about we agree to disagree, and revisit this in 10 years when BCH is Bitcoin and BTC isn\\'t?\\n\\nCan\\'t wait.\\n\\nRemindMe! 10 years> Alright, well how about we agree to disagree, and revisit this in 10 years when BCH is Bitcoin and BTC isn\\'t?\\n\\nAbsolutely delusional lol.

Let me know how I can help.goalies feeling left outBecause the poor bastards need more money don‚Äôt they!these are the kind of applications that are made possible with Bitcoin and usable cryptocurrencies - this is no longer possible with BTC.Ignoring the unanimous \"make the rich richer\" comments, I love this idea! As a concept it\\'s cool. In practice, the flaws can easily be worked out. :)  \\n\\n\\n/u/chaintipWhat we need is a platform in which celebrities commit an amount for each cause that goes to a project/charity that the users nominate.Better idea would be they pay us if they perform poorly!Oh yeah! Make the rich players richer, and the poor spectators poorer. The world‚Äôs balance is scaled and my faith in humanity is restored again!I like the idea, but I think we should send the crypto to a charity group that the play chooses, instead of tipping him. Since he probably has enough money.Those soccer player are getting paid very well to keep you sleeping. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEaw9O6pCrUThis is quite possibly the dumbest thing I\\'ve ever seen.\\n\\nFirst of all Cristiano Ronaldo + most strikers in the EPL get paid more than enough and this would barely make a dent in their net worth. When would you put up the QR code for the midfielders, defenders, and goalkeeper?\\n\\nSecond of all, it takes up huge screen space right when someone scores a goal, would non-crypto fans like that? It also provides absolutely zero revenue to any company that would have the power to do this.\\n\\nTo counter your point about this going to Ronaldo\\'s favourite charity, would all the strikers want to pick one? Why wouldn\\'t you donate to a charity you like? Seems like an unnecessary complication.\\n\\nThis is just wishful thinking to pump the crypto you own. Cool graphic though.This might be the most Bitcoin Cash post ever!\\n\\nAverage people donating money to the super rich in the name of adoption.\\n\\nGood for you!Yeh, let‚Äôs send more money to one of the richest people on the planet. Great idea. They can definitely take $10 of my total $100 net worthNobody cares about BCH lol.Great idea! That will show the world that BCH can scale massively on chain!dont forget to tip your landlord while you\\'re at itThat would make me work a hell of a lot harderMaybe not for the biggest club, but I mean there are definitely clubs where they players don\\'t make a lot of money in the smaller leagues.\\n\\nThat said, it kind of goes against the spirit of the sport IMO. First, it\\'s a team work when you score a goal. Secondly, a true supporter is with the team in hard times as well as good times. Wether a someone scores a goal or not shouldn\\'t make a difference.These soccer players are already rich, why do I need to send them money?Digital tipping has been around for a long time. There\\'s nothing innovative about the concept of sending a tip to a QR code displayed on a TV. \\n\\nSure, the crypto itself might be innovative, but not this concept.Sorry to double comment here, but it turns out I **can\\'t** even scan the QR code in the video, even at  full screen. Just because of this exact case I\\'d have to suggest using legacy addresses in this exact application. Check out my (legacy) avatar! Zooming in is sufficient to scan it, at any angle, and it would work even if it\\'s spinning around.\\n\\nIt turns out the only reason I\\'d use the CashAddr format is that it lets me spell out longer **vanity** addresses. 32 symbols lets us spell more, at least in theory, than 58. O\\'wise I consider them a disgrace.This is one feature that can\\'t be done on  lightning network.Ronaldo doesn‚Äôt need more money tbh lolYeah, why don‚Äôt we tip Bezos and Musk while we‚Äôre there.

I can code an EC plugin, like [VanityTXID](https://github.com/TinosNitso/VanityTXID-Plugin), to make it in auto for others. The broadcasters might need to be able to **switch** between the QR-in-logo versus logo-in-QR. We can even make it spin around and stuff, since phones can instantly scan at any angle.\\n\\nEdit: Since no access to private keys is required, a **web-app** should work better than wallet-plugin, but that requires paying money for a server and domain etc. I guess maybe both. The QR-in-logo should fit in better with green grass, etc.\\n\\nTBH I **can\\'t** even scan the one in the video, even with the video at full screen!

Chained transactions allow you to send unconfirmed coins instantly as well. \\n\\nCheating 0-conf would require an extensive Sybil attack, so buying tons of IP addresses, running several nodes that could handle the load of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of separate nodes, and then all the time that goes into setting that up.\\n\\nIf you want to be extra secure, you can use ZCE, or zero confirmation escrow, which renders a double spend attack useless, because the recipient will still receive their funds even if a double spend attempt is made (through incentives)You do not pay anything to receive it.\\n\\nAt this point, I can\\'t tell if you know how crypto works.

LolTo spend I doAnd he does to pay, he\\'s paying more in fees than I\\'m receivingPost me an invoiceSounds like you\\'re making it up lolHuh?It depends, a well connected node with many channels will be able to route transactions for cheaper, because it can get shorter routes\\n\\nHowever, having more channels means more on chain transactions to open them, which can get quite expensive, and at mass adoption scale, a single channel opening could start to cost upwards of 5$. So, either you only have a few channels, (which is already expensive, and puts you at more risk for having your funds locked up for a few weeks, or being censored), or you pay the extra premium for the lowered risk and censorship resistance.\\n\\nEven if you only opened a  single channel for 2$, it would be require hundreds of bitcoin cash transactions to reach that amount.\\n\\nSo, bch is likely cheaper.

That explains the continued smear campaign against BCH, if they fail to control the ‚Äúbcash scam‚Äù narrative, they know the game is over.The bitcoiner\\'s primary thesis is that central banks are manipulating bond rates downward to the detriment of economic growth, and bitcoin solves this.\\n\\nHe reveals his massive ignorance when he talks about the lightning network\\'s growth rate being 4% per week, and cuban responds with \"it\\'s starting from a small base\".  He seems to totally miss this point that it is easier for small things to grow faster.\\n\\nThis is the thing people ignore with regards to interest rates all the time.  There\\'s an xkcd about the \"fastest growing religion\". [https://xkcd.com/1102/](https://xkcd.com/1102/) Basically, it\\'s completely ridiculuous to compare growth rates of 2 different things of different sizes.\\n\\nYou may want to have crypto replace fiat, you may want to build an entirely voluntarist society and abolish the state.  Maybe you even have some good ideas about how to do that.\\n\\nBut what is simply ridiculuous, is directly comparing the growth rates of a dominant established system, with one that is a fraction of the size.  If I recall correctly, he says the worldwide bond market is something like $200 trillion.  Given the U.S. debt is $29 trillion, that figure seems believable. So even if the bond market loses half its value, in the next 5 years, and bitcoin(or crypto in general) increases by a factor of 10, the bond market would still be 5 times bigger than the crypto market ($20 trillion vs $100 trillion).\\n\\nWith rates and returns, it makes no sense to compare two different assets whose scale is completely different.  You would never directly compare the growth rate of grass with the growth rate of trees.  Any living thing or system, goes through different phases of growth, so trying to claim that a stagnant bond market is somehow holding back the rest of the economy from growth, and only bitcoin is the solution to this... It\\'s just unrealistic.\\n\\nIf this libertarian vision is your thing, do your thing, just don\\'t place the same growth expectations on traditional finance, and claim you are better because of your growth rate.\\n\\nCrypto mining is an important value signal, and is one of the things that helps it grow, this is why I am a fan of BCH, because it\\'s simple, functional, practical. I personally don\\'t care for the \"abolish the state\" line, but I think the ability to create digital currency is very valuable both for digital commerce, and as a cross-border financial tool that isn\\'t directly impacted by local instability.\\n\\n So many coins try to overcomplicate what makes a good coin, and I find BCH to be a good balance between functional,  simple, and likely to survive.If you only want to hear the BCH part, skip to 22:38.Lol ‚Äúremember when china turned off miners and the network didnt miss a beat‚Äù. Actually, the BTC chain almost froze to death that timeThis is a great demonstration of why he‚Äôs a billionaire and the other people in the discussion aren‚Äôt..Mark is answering all their questions but a lot of Mark‚Äôs questions are immediately dismissed.cuban has a whole recent tweet history of calling for\\n\\n1. deanonymization of smart contract deployers\\n2. triggerable taxation on btc (and presumably bch as well) whenever spent\\n\\namongst many other questionable comments about crypto\\n\\nhe\\'s the worst person to have represent the crypto community and if anything is just a grifter who will backstab and go against the crypto ethos.  \\n\\ni\\'m all for trolling modern btc maxis but let\\'s be careful with praising cuban seeing that he is staunchly pro-regulations.I\\'m sure this man cares deeply about the long term prosperity of cryptocurrenciesCongratulations! You\\'ve been tipped for your post. u/chaintip - See who else has been tipped [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/rbtc-tipper/submitted/)üëçSo the Lightning Network is \"nascent\" and also \"not new\". Make up your mind!this sub is the biggest echo chamber I\\'ve seen jeez.. The copeCult of personality bs... why should I listen to Cuban?The same guy who praises shit like sushi and titanI agree with Marc Cuban. Use Dogecoin for payments..\\n\\nI never listened to anyone that makes so much sense before.Marc Cuban knows fuck all about crypto! Anyone with half a brain won‚Äôt be taking advice from him!Why is the quality this bad?Mark Cuban sees some truths the BTC team tries to hide. Off the cuff it   \\nseems he is not a great debtor for challenging the   \\nprofessionally-developed false assumptions the BTC team uses. I do   \\nappreciate his efforts though. I think an edited demystification from   \\nhim could be more persuasive.Bitcoin imo will be a store of value only, great convo though.When is this thread never going to mention btc ever again?cant listen to this bad bad audio. ‚Äúnobody cares because it has no network effect‚Äù  \\n\\n\\nYea. That is literally untrue and therefore a bullshit argument. BCH has 90-100k tx pr. day and the 4th most value transferred after BTC, ETH and USDT (which is a scam).This is the same counterargument they make when they are asked about Monero. \"Oh but network effect\"..and how did they build this network effect of echoes? By continually attacking Monero over the years about \"bans/regulators\" when there was none, in fact they are probably begging whoever they can control to put effective bans around it like the corrupt exchanges etc.\\n\\nWeinstein tweeted this best. \"To build a cargo cult, airports and train stations must be destroyed first\"\\n\\nIt is impressive to see in my opinion. How they are getting away with it in broad daylight all while virtue signaling like never seen before in any revolution.The other part that went over their head is that the central bank isn‚Äôt operating in a productivity vacuum. If productivity increases the central bank won‚Äôt need to pull all of these shenanigans.I don\\'t care for \"abolish the state\" either, I like nation states. Life would be hell without them. However .... because of Bitcoin now being invented nation states are about to lose massive power in the next 50 years. The power they lose will go to corporations and some to individuals.Hmmm. That is the part where Mark says Bitcoin is bad because there is only 2 ways to get it. Mining or Buying. I will try to listen to the end. The audio is terrible.How would they know? They don\\'t use it.I don\\'t twitter or follow Cuban... but I had gotten about halfway through it and decided to call it quits... and came to say something similar.\\n\\nIts not even clear what Cuban is trying to argue here.  I feel like I probably need to have been following him on tweeter first to know what his position is?  Because it doesn\\'t seem to have been communicated in this conversation.\\n\\nJust because he doesn\\'t agree with small blockers, doesn\\'t mean he would agree with me.Yeah, Cuban arguing on Twitter that Bitcoin can\\'t be a currency because every spend is a taxable event ...\\n\\n... that\\'s just pro-regulation argumentation, and very US-centric.\\n\\nNot going to put him on any pedestal for Bitcoin-as-real-world-currency adoption.***\\nu/btcxio, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2heu54zw2ka96et9wdczxvfs0p4smcr4rfda) `0.00129864 BCH` | `~0.84 USD` by u/rbtc-tipper\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***Good botIt\\'s a baby that will never grow up.You are not paying attention and taking quotes out of context (on purpose of course). \\n\\nThis guy is trolling but for anyone else, when the Maxi Ethan Klein-sounding idiot says that LN can be used to buy coffee TODAY, Mark is generous and says, \"well, its still nascent\".

Rock on and cheers.Times are tough when Mark can\\'t afford a decent broadband connection.Yeah.It is painful to listen to Cuban\\'s poor internet connection.When BCHers that used BTC like BCH before 2017 dies, more or less.This recording is pretty much only about BTC...  maybe I\\'m not understanding your question?I\\'m always amazed at billionaires who can\\'t afford a good microphone and internet connection wherever they are .>\"To build a cargo cult, airports and train stations must be destroyed first\"\\n\\nBeautiful. \\n\\nI\\'m looking at Chivo/Strike/Lightning wallets and shaking my head.

Not good.I was going to make the same point, I don\\'t want to \"abolish the state\", I want to abolish the state\\'s control over money. We all hold money, but they hold far too much of it and dilute our stake far too quickly through inflation.So many truths wrapped up in this comment.Marc said both things.Living with my mom is a family choice. I support her.. Everyone plays videogames who cares. Oh no I tried a few drugs in my life.. ur ignorant and u showed it. U go for personal attacks because ur insecure. Enjoy ur poor life of being a closed minded goblin. And ur so desperate u look for validation from billionaires like cuban that have no idea what they\\'re talking about. This guy joined the space a few months ago. But probably so did youSounds like he rocks, I love those thingsYea... and Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and Michael Saylor. Cheers to all the billionaires!\\n\\nLolThey‚Äôre about as good as Bitcoin becoming the world reserve currency.Yeah, okay, umm 2% inflation target. Steady for over 30 years now. If you live in argentina maybe, but US, UK, australia, japan. No.\\n\\nInflation in the 70s was due to oil shortages, and today it\\'s due to supply chains and \"labor issues\".\\n\\nWhether or not states lose monetary influence is an open question, but inflation is not a good argument. It is easier than ever to invest in the stock market, etc.\\n\\nI really don\\'t get the argument that the government should be responsible for providing a permanent way to store your money for decades. Investment is a personal responsibility, it\\'s not the governments job to make sure you have a risk free return on money.People blame the state for inflation, but it doesn\\'t work that way. So long as inflation is low and stable there\\'s no issue. The only issue is being able to write stable contracts, and invest your money how you choose.  It is generally much easier to renegotiate with rising prices than falling prices.  It\\'s just basic human psychology. If you tell someone they are getting a 2% raise, that\\'s much more socially palatable than decreasing wages 2% per year.\\n\\nNow, I would have no issue with 2% deflation either, but it would just make a lot of things harder, because most people take money too seriously.What an interesting insight into your life, thank you, sincerely. \\n\\nI\\'m high so am in no mood to fight, sorry about what I said before and don\\'t remember reading your comment that made me so upset. Buut, looking back you do seem to be baiting people for no reason. \\n\\nSo while I don\\'t want to argue, I\\'m going to apologize for my comments about your family and hobbies but stick with my assessment that you sound like an absolutely awful person and the sooner you stop posting here the better.so, nominally zero> People blame the state for inflation, but it doesn\\'t work that way.\\n\\nBy definition, inflation is when you have *more dollars chasing fewer goods*.\\n\\nThe most malignant form of inflation comes from the state through money printing. Need a new nuke submarine... whirrrr!\\n\\nYou can also see inflation when interest rates are low, which makes borrowing easy, driving up speculative investing (gambling) and spurred on by runaway fractional reserves. Here again, prime lending rates and reserve requirements are state controlled.\\n\\nThe only other case for inflation is when production slows and supply constricts, often due to resource restrictions. There can be natural forces that restrict resources, e,g, natural disaster, but here too most restrictions come in the form of regulation or taxation based on political maneuvers from the state.\\n\\nThe state wants inflation, as it motivates the masses to spend their money. They require that nagging feeling that if they don\\'t spend their money today, it will be worth less (or worthless) tomorrow. If people don\\'t spend their money, the state has no way of collecting taxes. They only collect taxes on commerce through sales taxes AND/or payroll taxes. Without inflation, the people are apt to hold on to their funds.This is the big argument economists make against a deflationary currency like Bitcoin(s) and their fixed supply, as people will hodl their coins too much and the economy will grind to a halt.You perhaps misunderstand me. Of course the state is responsible for the inflation of their currency. But they are bidding on the open market, and the rate of inflation is (usually) a known variable. Anyone is free to buy gold, or silver, or stocks, or cryptocurrency, etc.  By the time someone is adult, they should know what investing is.\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are actually incensed about taxes.  Sure, that\\'s fine. If you think taxes are too high, or taxes artificially suppress valuable economic activity that\\'s one thing.  And as for the latter, it\\'s a commonly discussed issue, of how taxes create distortions.  \\n\\nIf you are just looking out for all the grandmas who don\\'t understand fdic rules and sitting on millions in the bank uninsured with zero gains, great.  But if someone doesn\\'t have that level of competency, they are better off with traditional banking.  Do you think they will be able to handle key management and understand custodianship issues?\\n\\nNo of course not.  There are plenty of good reasons to want cryptocurrencies. Savings that persist despite social or political changes(although arguably metal is better), cross border payments, avoiding shady payment processors and chargebacks.\\n\\nIn fact, the mere existence of alternatives makes traditional financial systems more accountable, because there is always the potential for some migration in the margin.  And if you want to say, having crypto as an alternative, makes states more accountable to maintain stable inflation, then that\\'s great.  But while memes about declining purchasing power may be catchy, most people realize that they aren\\'t living off of money their grandparents or great grandparents saved in 1932, when the economy was a fraction of its size today.\\n\\nInflation is just an increase in the price level, or conversely a decline in the purchasing power of a currency. Saying it\\'s more dollars chasing fewer goods is just wrong.  That is a hypothesis as to what causes inflation, and sometimes is true, and sometimes not. You can have inflation even with a shrinking supply of money.You realize that every company on the planet \"prints money\" in the form of stocks, right? I\\'m honestly asking, because i don\\'t know you: do you know what a capital raise is? Companies issue more shares to raise more money for a project.\\n\\nWhen a state issues new money, it\\'s exactly the same thing.  They are \"raising capital\", just with fewer steps.\\n\\nThis is what private sector \"printing money\" looks like: https://electrek.co/2020/12/08/tesla-tsla-5-billion-capital-raise-insane-stock-price/Here\\'s another example of \"printing money\" https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-jumps-after-stock-offering-equity-raise-2021-6?op=1Ever run a business? I\\'m honestly asking.\\n\\nDid you know that Tesla has assets? Did you know they also have intellectual property and labor? Ever heard of dividends? How about basic accounting, where Assets - Liabilities = Equity and that stocks have a very similar sounding nickname, \"equities\". Coincidence?\\n\\nOnce the stocks are created they are traded on... wait for it... a Stock Exchange. This implies an important point, people must trade something to OWN the stock, you guessed it, their USD. So people trade their USD to own stock, known generally as equities, because they OWN part of the company, more specifically part of the company equity.\\n\\nEver notice how the stocks owned by the people are called \"shares\". Hmm, that implies they OWN a share of something. That\\'s right, they own a share of the business equity.\\n\\nAnd should the company wish to issue more stock, it does dilute the value of all outstanding shares (*all boats rise and fall*) but this action is required to be documented and published for all shareholders.\\n\\nAnd of course if the business is wildly successful because they are selling a product everyone wants, then when the next guy that wants to buy a share of the company, he must pay the going rate to OWN a piece of the action. Someone must decide to sell their share to another and this is done on the Exchange, mentioned earlier. This exchange trade is done when a price is agreed, this is know as the market price, and if the company is prosperous at the time, the market price is higher than when the OWNER bought his share.\\n\\nAt that moment, the seller thinks the USDs offered are more valuable than his share of the company, and the buyer thinks the share of the company is worth more than the USDs he\\'ll have to part with. But notice that no USDs were lost or gained in this trade!\\n\\nOf course, if the seller sells for more, this is called a \"Capital Gain\". Why don\\'t they simply call it \"profit\" instead? Because this is an exchange of assets and equity, not the net of income after expenses. Of course, don\\'t worry, the still gov\\'t loves to collect taxes on the capital gained in the sale of equity. \\n\\nThis IS NOT the same thing the state does. Sure, any municipal or gov\\'t body can raise money through bonds, but we\\'re talking about the outright money printing by simply having the Fed Res \"buy\" bogus debt by simply making an adjusting journal entry.I did some testing and read.cash/noise.cash links are still not allowed in comments, but we are working on this and it will be fixed, probably today.\\n\\nThe reason is I don\\'t know how priorities work in automod rules yet.

Roger demanded that I obey Craig Wright.  ... we can see how well that worked out for him and everyone that listened to him.What particular thing are you looking for a source for?Its better if we use our mind and then someone suggestion but i like BTC so its good.Coretards like you would love to see less post about the truth huh?\\n\\nI bet you also still own the crippled shitcoin, this is why it offends you.üòòThat\\'s why I\\'m saying posts about BTC are fine lolSidebar states that it\\'s a sub for all Bitcoin related discussionConsidering nullc ended up coming here to comment, my thoughts are this is substantial. Nullc spoke very highly of this dev, and said he created the node system we use today... this is not just \"another dev.\"\\n\\nThat being said, egon why do you talk in emojis. That probably isn\\'t earning you much love. It makes it seem like you are speaking in grunts or something.And reality is more hurting then anything else sometime.Even more sad that he fully sold out to cripple bitcoin.> I have literally been refreshing r/btc 50 times a minute all day\\n\\nSeek help!Hope you were suitably rewarded for your work in crippling BTC\\'s true potentialOkay, definitely salty!You havent been involved but you are here, I don\\'t think you want to give up. I can see you have a bit of a bad reputation and im sure you wonder if people even read your words. I want you to know you are valuable and an equal like anyone else here. You still have a chance to contribute in a meaningful way. You are suspecting we are an organization, like the competition. Let me teach you how individualism works.\\n\\nIt works like this, someone like me can join and be appreciated and contribute meaningfully with a critical discussion, in the matter of a day. It works like this, I can come here on day one and confront you with my own ideas, even though you should be way above me and in normal circumstances we would not be having a discussion. This could not happen in the r/bitcoin forum. They have lost the way. If you can\\'t see that so have you.\\n\\nThat\\'s what this place is. Your accusations of a mob that is controlled by a single entity are absurd. This place is more decentralized than you are making the accusation of, and there are many conflicting views here its not nearly as clean as you seem to think.\\n\\nYou have a chance to contribute meaningfully. Even if everyone here hates you - it\\'s not their choice if you want to contribute to our community. Think about that. No matter how much people here hate you, it wouldn\\'t limit your ability to contribute. Think about it. Think about what else can offer you that in your life.\\n\\nThink about my offer. You have a place here, but you already knew that. You knew that long before I did. I hope being confronted by someone as green as me can encourage you to consider new ideas on your path forward. It\\'s not easy to change but I believe people can because I\\'ve seen it happen.I resent that you are belittling an open community for using node software created for community projects. Listen to yourself. That is a ridiculous argument. What was that statement you made about really smart people being easily fooled?\\n\\nYou deserve every word of my lecture. I hope you come back and reread it. I hope you never forget my words and are bothered by them. I hope your beliefs have sincerely become challenged. I dont think you find me to be a troll. I know my words are painful but they are not hate. \\n\\nYou can say I really care about you for going this far to get you to reconsider your preconceived notions. You didn\\'t have to read a word of my lecture, but you did. That tells me your subconscious wants to find the value in my words.100% agree.  Just wanted to show my support.I guess there are by far more banned over at r/Bitcoin and you should be best to know - stop projecting your actions onto all othersYour \"deboooonking\" doesn\\'t really work when its not 1 admin, but many pages of user reports which probably include some admins, and one quote from a non-admin which sums up what everyone is saying - so excuse me, for anyone else reading here are quotes from other admins on [the talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=36639732#User:Gmaxwell):\\n\\n* That proves that Gmaxwell did engage in sockpuppetry which means it was right to extend the block - Alhutch (admin)\\n\\n* He\\'s not known for making \"reasonable, patient attempts to protect the Foundation,\" unfortunately, but for acts of aggression that have led other users to leave the project. I\\'m concerned that, in his most recent statements, he has announced his intention to continue being disruptive, and has said he\\'ll evade any blocks that are applied. That\\'s a direct threat to the project, not an attempt to protect it. - SlimVirgin (admin)\\n\\n* ... it\\'s odd that anyone should hesitate at the notion that Gmaxwell be blocked for any other than practical reasons ... our response isn\\'t to agonise over whether blocking is a good idea, but to block the sockpuppets as and when they appear - Mel Etitis (admin)\\n\\n So, when you later try to influence public opinion, your reputation as someone who is incredibly manipulative may bring into question the legitimacy of what you are saying. There is a good example just a few comments up, where you are still engaged in this sort of behavior. Good luck fighting against p2p cash for the world with your cia and banker pals, you will not win.Hello person who is probably more important than I realize. I was recently converted to bitcoin cash and it had nothing to do with lawsuits, but instead being able to see the vision. I think you are being too hateful. Do you think im so stupid that I was not able to reach these conclusions by myself? I have no idea who Roger Ver is and he in no way incentivized me to find a place here. \\n\\nThe past may have been led by people like you, but the future of cypherpunk are in the hands of individuals like me. Instead of being so hateful and bitter you should use your skills to help new comers like me. Perspective of someone who is much lower in caste than you. Maybe it can help.Nobody is banned from this subreddit. You are the most disgusting Bcore scammer and you\\'re trolling here because you haven\\'t been banned, that\\'s the proof.> Noted: ShadowOfHarbringer is another creep that supports using SLAPP lawsuits to silence and censor Bitcoin developers.\\n\\nI have no idea what some of these words you are using even mean, I suspected you are simply mumbling something random because of some kind of mental problem.\\n\\nYou know, I am not a psychiatrist so I cannot for sure say whether this is a mental problem or some other problem, but I know that it\\'s never too late to get help, you still have a life ahead of you.\\n\\nLet other people help you before it is too late, you deserve this.You must be a Faketoshi fan.Probably salty ü§îShadowOfHarbringer is also a raving lunatic lol. He might be the only person who supports BCH without being paid to do soListening to CW was far less detrimental to this space than listening to you, sadly.Once you are able to handle criticism, then you can start talking shit. You missed a critical step in growing to that position.Hi n00b.  My tenure in crypto extends to 2011/2012, I assure you I am well aware of the truth and hold many coins.  I am not offended, I am annoyed that I have to constantly wade through OP\\'s sensationalized or propagandist trash.What I find most interesting is that the disdain for you seems to be growing.  You\\'re not as well received as you used to be, and for good reason.\\n\\nYou may want to reflect on that a bit.  Or don\\'t, I don\\'t really care because you\\'re not someone I ever think about outside the brief moment where I happen to scroll past a post.Egon it\\'s interesting to me that they say you\\'re negative when they just gossiped about you like children and said to block you because they dont want to hear your negative opinion. \\n\\nThis is in stark contrast to the conversation that happened between me and nullc.Egon just tell me the way to put som egif into the comment section.It does but that doesn\\'t mean you have to. Just because McDonald\\'s has all options on the Menu doesn\\'t mean you must order everything. You only order the optimal food you want. Just because you are allowed to do something doesn\\'t mean you have to.Factual statement: Developer left Core team - > Brain drain of BTC development. \\n\\nWhy are folks so uncomfortable and salty with basic facts? If you need protection from reality, I would suggest to visit  r/bitcoin, they are quite good at \"protecting\" you from harsh reality.We love Bitcoin and p2p money. We hate the crippled shitcoin BTC.\\n\\nLearn your history, idiot.I like honesty üòòHere\\'s a sneak peek of /r/Buttcoin using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year!\\n\\n\\\\#1: [If we are \"just as bad\" as the butters...](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/ov6i6y/if_we_are_just_as_bad_as_the_butters/)  \\n\\\\#2: [BTC is Stealing Revenue from Gold Miners](https://i.redd.it/80ad1i0flig61.jpg) | [79 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lgd58q/btc_is_stealing_revenue_from_gold_miners/)  \\n\\\\#3: [Soon](https://i.redd.it/c5bj60488kk61.png) | [203 comments](https://np.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/lvvrel/soon/)\\n\\n----\\n^^I\\'m ^^a ^^bot, ^^beep ^^boop ^^| ^^Downvote ^^to ^^remove ^^| [^^Contact ^^me](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=sneakpeekbot) ^^| [^^Info](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/) ^^| [^^Opt-out](https://np.reddit.com/r/sneakpeekbot/comments/o8wk1r/blacklist_ix/)I lost hope for a long time but now I cant wait to get my next magic internet money tip. This really is web.3 - we have never had financial freedom like this before. To imagine I thought defi and layer two were some great achievement for any length of time is a point of shame. Lightning network is probably what someone like me who dosent know anything would come up with. I wouldn\\'t hire myself to write code.u/chaintipI don\\'t use rBitcoin. Now you\\'re changing the subject.  I don\\'t doubt that there are more people banned there (it also has many many times more users too).  But the fact is that this subreddit ruthlessly censors views incompatible with it\\'s owner\\'s businesses.  True: it doesn\\'t stop every poster or every contrary view: but enough of them to make sure that anyone arguing against the party line is alone and outnumberd an army of abusive anonymous posters, many with rather short lived account histories.  E.g. what does an account from 2018 know of anything Bitcoins\\' history relative to BCash? -- well it may know a lot when its a sockpuppet.> That proves that Gmaxwell did engage in sockpuppetry which means it was right to extend the block - Alhutch (admin)\\n\\nNope.\\n\\n> Checkuser says: These appear not to be Gmaxwell at all, but a troll stirring up shit. \\n\\nAn admin with actual access to the IP logs confirmed it was just someone else  trolling there.  (Other than the bot accounts which were explicitly disclosed to be mine).\\n\\nAs was pointed out, I was made an administrator, checkuser, and chief research officer in the year after I got into that edit war.  The very users who blocked me from editing for a day were themselves blocked from editing in their own disputes, it wasn\\'t a particularly usual thing for people to get into a hot headed disagreement with other users.  So if Wikipedia and Wikipedans didn\\'t think it was a big deal 6 months after it happened, why should anyone else care at all *15 years* after it happened?\\n\\nWhat, exactly, were *you* doing 16 years ago?  Your account history seems to only go back three years.  I guess what\\'s good for the goose isn\\'t good for the gander?\\n\\nAnd meanwhile-- you\\'ve still haven\\'t answered how any of this has even the slightest thing to do with you and this subreddit celebrating shutting down one of the people responsible for creating the node software your currency depends on being shut down and censored by a frivolous 7 billion dollar lawsuit.  But I suppose you figure you still look like a good guy compared to the other person in this thread bragging about his *murder conviction*?   ... but no no, the fact that I got into an argument on the internet 16 years ago and got blocked from using a website for 24 hours is far more important than the convicted violent felons around here.I\\'m not important.\\n\\nIf you want to be helped, perhaps don\\'t pretend you know everything and insult people who\\'ve been into Bitcoin for over a decade? --- or go ahead and insult people, I don\\'t care and it seems no one else here does either.  At the end of the day, the loss will be yours and not anyone elses.  This isn\\'t a useful place to learn in any case because almost all Bitcoiners are ruthlessly censored here, I\\'m not because I\\'m kept around as a token punching bag so they can pretend that (1) they aren\\'t censoring people (the dozens people I know personally who are banned refutes that) and (2) they can pretend that the points I\\'m making are only supported by myself and refuted by everyone else... never mind the fact that the real bitcoin subreddit has like 3 million subscribers compared to a tiny fraction in this echo chamber.\\n\\nIf you like bcash then great for you, just don\\'t make the mistake that other people here make and fraudulently claim that its bitcoin, or promote it with dishonest claims about it or against Bitcoin.  If so long as you\\'re not dishonest no Bitcoiner should have any issue with you.\\n\\nThat said... People thinking like you sound like you\\'re thinking, following the investment advice of this subreddit have already lost >98% of their positions compared to just holding onto bitcoin.When you talk to a long timer here of the very few there are, many of them could easily have been independently wealthy if they\\'d just stayed in Bitcoin and not followed the bcash piped piper:\\n\\nWhen this subreddit really took off Bitcoin was selling for $335. If someone invested $5000 on Bitcoin then and just held onto it they\\'d have approximately a million dollars of Bitcoin today.  If they followed this subreddit\\'s advice first buying into ethereum when it was hyped here as the solution to Bitcoin\\'s woes then buying into BCH they\\'d have less money than they started with (if they only did the BCH part they\\'d have about $13k instead of a million dollars they\\'d have if they just stuck with Bitcoin).  If they also followed the dash hype here they\\'d be even worse off.\\n\\nSo following this subreddit\\'s advice isn\\'t something I\\'d recommend, but if you want to go that route -- it\\'s only a problem for you and your family. Not a problem for me.\\n\\nAnd, no... I don\\'t think you\\'re stupid, though I think you\\'ve been tricked by a widespread heavily funded commercial campaign put on by greedy people who don\\'t care about freedom or autonomy, just about how much money they can make selling defective assets to newbies.  Anyone can be conned. In fact, smart people can be *more* vulnerable to being conned because they have a greater ability to rationalize their bad decisions.  A fool will say \"That is obviously bad\" and leave it at that, but it can take some intelligence to talk yourself into making a really dumb move.A tremendous number of Bitcoiners are banned here. Just to give one high profile example: Bashco who is one of the most active mods on the 103rd largest subreddit, an 8 year long redditor with over 80k comment karma is banned here.> Listening to CW was far less detrimental to this space than listening to you, sadly.\\n\\nGood to know, Mr. account created May 21 2020.

Smart people can be conned more easily. You\\'re just patronizing me trying to imply im more smart than you are. Based on your own words its more likely that you have been conned than me. It\\'s quite easy for me to see the truth, I have no vested interest in any lies. I want the truth for the sake of truth, wherever it takes me I do not lose money. I doubt you can say the same, my friend. By your own admission my perspective should have substantial meaning to you, because my eye sees a world you will never see. You have no other way to interpret new experiences except through newcomers like me, you have far too heavy of a bias with your position. If you believe you have no bias, even someone as stupid as me can see you\\'ve let ego ruin your intelligence.You\\'ve been tricked by a widespread heavily funded commercial campaign put on by greedy people who don\\'t care about freedom or autonomy, just about how much money they can make selling defective assets to newbies. Anyone can be conned.Bitcoin cash is bitcoin. Tricked by a conspiracy is what I was before. I have done my due diligence, I can\\'t force you to make the right choice.\\n\\nIf you did think someone asking questions and wanting to learn more, recognizing their own ignorance, made them stupid than I would really question what you considered intelligent. Do you believe you are in a position where you no longer need to answer questions? Do you believe no one could possibly give you an answer?\\n\\nThis is why I have passed you, because there is no thought or concept that I am too afraid to understand. There is no criticism that I am afraid to hear. There is no person that I am not willing to have a discussion with and to hear their worst opinions. As a person who spent their life in fear and am now choosing to live outside of fear -  I can recognize that fear has consumed you. If you weren\\'t afraid you wouldn\\'t be here. There is no reason for you to be here except in fear.\\n\\nThe beautiful thing is we are all important. There is a lot of meaning in my previous statement, no one here can stop you from becoming one of us. That\\'s not something you find in most \"organizations.\" It can only happen in a population of individuals.As a mod of this sub -- trust me. If we practiced the type of banning that is practiced on /r/bitcoin, you\\'d be the first to go.  Yet you are still here.  \\n\\nIf BashCo is banned, he must have broken a rule.Bashco is a POS, something you can relate to, no doubt.You offered to help CSW knowing full well he was a con man, so you‚Äôre no better than him: https://www.trustnodes.com/2018/11/11/gregory-maxwell-admits-he-emailed-craig-wright-to-offer-assistanceYes, because account registration dates mean everything  on a forum where they\\'re free to create, take less than a minute and don\\'t require email verification.\\n\\nI simply could not have possibly abandoned any old accounts.\\n\\nSee those straws Greg?

This sub was created before Bitcoin forked. TBH this sub should be renamed \"rbitcoin\" since it allows all discussion of all topics Bitcoin-related, and rbitcoin should be moved here, since that community only allows discussion of the BTC version of Bitcoin. But there\\'s no facility for renaming Reddit subs, so we\\'re just stuck with the names we have.It was an observation based remark, sorry if it offended you.\\n\\nI recommend obtaining a functional brain as a first step. :)Calling someone an idiot was uncalled for, but we are all probably guilty of that here on reddit.

This is supposedly an \"uncensored subreddit\", which means that if he broke a rule it would be a *reddit rule* and he\\'d be suspended from the whole site (like /u/Bitcoinxio -- previously the most active mod here was,  and he now evades the site wide ban by posting as /u/btcxio).\\n\\nIf you care about breaking the rules, why do you sit quietly while people flagrantly evade sitewide bans?It gets better when you put all his actions in order too.\\n\\nGreg Maxwell did offer his assistance to a known conman and it took over 2 years for him to finally publish a paraphrased version of the original email...only after he got sued. We still dont know what the original email said and what support it really offered as both Faketoshi and Greg Maxwell are serial liars. \\n\\nAll thats clear is that Greg Maxwell and Faketoshi had some relationship that Maxwell wants to bury by bringing up others who were involved with CSW. This is why u/nullc has been doing damage control lately by spamming the forums with Rogers involvement with CSW but not spamming his own involvement with CSW.I did not. That article is not truthful. I [wrote wright *mocking him* and published the entire email verbatim](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9vcj4u/psa_surprised_no_one_mentioned_this_yet_one_year/e9c7q9u/) and have only written to mock him and encourage him to give up his scam.Nope. \\n\\nPro BTC content is heavily downvoted. You\\'ll be called a troll. You\\'ll be blocked and hated, until you leave. Which eventually happens to everyone with half a brain. It\\'s sick and toxic here. \\n\\nOn the other hand, pro BCH content is heavily upvoted, even when its complete bullshit. Doesn\\'t matter. Upvotes for you. \\n\\nI\\'ve seen and done both. Countless times. This happens everyday, all day. \\n\\nAlso, moving subs is a breeze. Look no further than how /r/BCH is set. The ulterior motives for staying here are blatantly obvious to anyone. \\n\\nUltimately, you hurt only yourselves. Until the bitter end...Which may not be long, if the last few years offer any indication. Smarten up.bad botYou have done the complete opposite of what you were hoping to do. I find it quite audacious of you to say im being negative to you and being blind. You\\'re being sensitive now? Because im being critical? When was the last time someone here gave you the time of day? Grab a cup of coffee and reread my posts - tell me when the last time someone you disagreed with spoken to you with that much respect.\\n\\nDon\\'t be a baby. You are failing to convince me of anything. It\\'s very apparent that I am very open to honest criticism. All you are doing is telling me how wrong I am because you say so - and than saying that I am being \"negative\" to you because I am not accepting your world view. That is horribly manipulative. You have an opportunity to redeem yourself. You still do. It wont be my choice if you take the opportunity, so stop pretending it is.\\n\\nI don\\'t believe you\\'re not earnest. I just think you have a fair bit of cognitive dissonance making it difficult for us to be on the same page. How can we have an honest conversation if you can\\'t even be honest with yourself.> Bullshit.\\n\\nSuch unbecoming harsh language. Tsk tsk. Very rude.That link does not contain the entire email, verbatim. You say that it\\'s what your email**s** to Craig \"look like.\" To me, that doesn\\'t even mean it\\'s a faithful quote of any particular email, though it could be. In any case, where is the full text of the email in which you wrote this?\\n\\n> I believe it would be adverse for interests that concern me if your influence or prominence in BCH were in any way diminished. I am not aware of how I could be of aid in repairing this situation, but it seemed to me that it would be prudent to at least offer my discreet assistance.>Anyway, both r/bitcoin and r/btc aren‚Äôt really censorship free. Both subs ban people that think differently\\n\\nThis is completely untrue. It\\'s pretty hard to get banned from this sub. Look around. There are countless accounts that just troll away. We don\\'t ban them. It would be so easy. But, this sub holds itself to a pretty high moderation standard. The rules in the sidebar are pretty much the only way to get banned here. I have no problem with banning people who can\\'t comport themselves according to those rules. But \"thinking differently\" isn\\'t one of them.be the change you want to see in the worldThe thing about a community is that we are as weak as our weakest member.

You say Bitcoin is superior because ‚Äúthe market says so‚Äù. And your conclusion to this perceived truth I can only guess is the price correct? Well, on that I would be very cautious and not a little skeptical since the market has two sides to it when it comes to value: that is perceived value and actual value (intrinsic or functional if you will). Perceptions change with time, but function is as long as utility and usability last. As a businessman and somewhat outsider I personally don‚Äôt know what will win out since I have seen this go both ways in the market. But I myself err on the side of utility, and I started with Bitcoin core and ended with Bitcoin cash for that self same reason. Now I do plenty of market speculation and play the field as far as judging market mood, but I tend to hold my chips in value plays (things that work or show promise of working). And I humbly say this, how can anyone honestly think Bitcoin serves as anything more than market speculation? It doesn‚Äôt spend anymore, it doesn‚Äôt have any sort of smart contract or token development going on with it, all it can do is just sit there. I suppose like a lump of gold if you will. And maybe that is the wisdom of their play right? With the whole store of value thing, but it definitely goes against the original intent of the creator, which is the embodiment of irony since the whole split was over ‚Äúbeing true to the coin‚Äù and not increasing block size. But I digress, I have already probably gone far out of turn.I wasn\\'t hoping to do anything. I don\\'t want to convince you.  I\\'ve offered some thoughts and you\\'re free to take them, or not. Your decision-- I\\'ve offered you my earnest views and common courtesy of responding to your message, even though it is offtopic and I think more than a little insensitive-- After all, I complained about a vicious con man hitting the authors of the Bitcoin software with a 7 billion dollar lawsuit and complained that this subreddit is celebrating it (which seems more than a little ungrateful!), and your reply was to lecture me?\\n\\nAs far as your offer of redemption: Thanks but no thanks. I don\\'t care about what you think of me. My comment about negativity was simply because you misheard a polite and earnest remark as patronizing, which was not intended. My guess was that your negative views of me are blinding you-- but I was mistaken to assume.\\n\\nI wish you no ill will but I don\\'t see any reason to spend any time persuading you of anything.When someone gaslights you and moves the goal posts like this:\\n\\n\"Nobody is banned from this subreddit.\" \"Plenty of Bitcoiners are, BashCo for example.\"  \"he must have broken a rule\"\\n\\nthen to respond any less sharply than I have would be uncivilized, as it would make me complicit with the fraud you are perpetrating on the public by failing to express the well deserved outrage and pretending that it\\'s an acceptable thing. It isn\\'t.\\n\\nThe moderators of this subreddit are lying censors, employed by a convicted felon, who defraud the public in a multitude of ways including by falsely claiming that the subreddit is uncensored and that Bitcoiners aren\\'t regularly banned here.Thank you for calling out his bullshit.

I can understand how resentment may make you feel there is no validity to my criticism.

Why would anyone want BTC over Doge?Really depends on what metric you are looking at. Adoption? Price? Users? Supply limit? Average time users hold the token? Trust? Tx through put? Development? If your statement held any water then the price hasn\\'t reflected that since well, ever.Yeah, btc got many problems in transaction and fluctuates a lot nowadays.Sure, if you look at it on the metric of transaction speed and cost. But then it has no devs, no max supply, more weak hand users, less hashrate, less global adoption. You are an absolute legend Roger and you are one of the main reasons I have BCH in my stack but surely you can understand why people want BTC over doge. Tx speed is great but ledger security, supply cap and adoption are more important to more people as shown by free market forces.Damn right, bitcoin is being used by many and it\\'s not that fast now.Please, just stop.I\\'ll stop when any of these claims ever come true.

While it\\'s great that you can earn comissions when users do swaps or sell, people who trade/sell actively are not going to use your app, they are going to use others. I believe the focus should be on saving some crypto instead of fiat, using it as money wherever they can, etc. Bitcoin.com is still suffering a slow way out of relevance by not identifying and focusing on its unique value proposition - which is not enabling swaps, nor becoming another \"exodus\".\\n\\nOne year ago I suggested a way to really make the wallet stand out: enable a crypto gift card service like that of \"Bitpay Shop\" or Coingate gift cards, within the app. Access to the map from the main screen, populating the map with all shops of the brands whose gift cards are available... and you become THE wallet to live off of crypto (be it with bch, or btc - users will compare the experience). Even /u/MemoryDealers  liked the idea as he forwarded my email to you.\\nI can\\'t help but feel a little bit disappointed at bitcoin.com giving up to the current speculative nature of the market and going the route of a jack of all trades, instead of doubling down on the voice Roger had given the brand, that cryptocurrencies are better money that will replace fiat in due time. Bitcoin.com never put all its energy in enabling crypto use as money before pivoting towards a new direction, did it? I mean, I live off crypto (BCH) and I use Bitpay wallet more than yours: 3 taps and I have exchanged BCH for a barcode on screen of store credit of multiple everyday merchants. There\\'s a big need in the cryptospace for a wallet to have everything needed to live off of crypto, and it\\'s not yet satisfied (0conf BCH, merchant map & everyday gift cards/store credit).\\n\\nAbout the swaps, consider offering decentralized, low fee swaps of Thorchain instead of centralized, high fee ones like sideshift\\'s. Shapeshift and other wallets have implemented them and are going the full decentralization route. It seems counterintuitive for bitcoin.com to go the closed source, centralized services route when there is another way.\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I\\'m all for electronic cash but this commercial is just weird. Probably a typical US commercial.The [bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) new user flow is brilliant.

If 2 % of the hashing power in btc grouped together and forms a cartel they can 51% attack bch. The other way around it doesn‚Äôt come even remotely close.\\n\\nHow would you know there is not already a 51% carte on BTC?\\n\\nIf so they could reverse BTC anytime and its security would be therefore zero: **regardless of total hash power**>\\tBecause increasing the block size is not a long term scaling solution.\\n\\nIncreasing is not a long term it is the original design.\\n\\nI recommend to read some satoshi posts.It is perfectly possible to process the entire world‚Äôs transactions by increasing block size.  The reason is that the original bitcoin design scales linearly with transaction volume.  With technology that is already several years old the life cycle cost for one node to process one million transactions is about $1 USD.  Thus a highly distributed network of 10,000 nodes would be able to process each transaction for less than $0.01.  \\n\\nThere is no need for improvements in network or computer hardware performance to achieve this price/performance nor scale, nor is there any need need to change the blockchain formats, the so called ‚Äúconsensus protocol‚Äù,  with the one exception of increasing or removing the block size limit.  It will only be necessary to remove unnecessary bottlenecks in node software to allow for fully parallel processing of individual transactions.  This is a straightforward software engineering problem and does not require any invention of complex multi-layered Rube Goldberg contraptions such as Lightning Network.\\n\\nWhy is this possible?  It‚Äôs because Satoshi‚Äôs original design, as outlined in his concise white paper, admits a fully parallelized implementation and allows each user secure access to the network without running a node.  His original design also explains how it is is not necessary for each node to store historical information, only active coin holdings.They won\\'t get full.  If they do, the network will be 28x bigger under 28mb blocks.  Keeping them 1mb only helps layer 2.Rubbishthe higher fees the more centralised, btc already excludes 6 billion peopleJust check her signatureIf you think Nano is centralized and PoS, you didn\\'t really do your research on it.\\n\\nIt was \"premined\", as in, the total supply was available on d1.

Or do you judge all layer 2 solutions based on LN?\\nBecause I\\'ll agree that LN sucks, but that doesn\\'t mean that all of them have to suck.\\n\\nIn fact, LN would work a lot better with Bitcoin cash simply because it would be a lot more economical to open and close channelsVery simple answer... \\n\\nBlockstream discovered that they can generate revenues by forcing consumers to use their proprietary layer-2 products. This of course only works if layer-1 is unusable, which is why they keep it at 1 mb, and fund propaganda campaigns aimed at discouraging anyone from using layer-1 of the pre-segwit fork (BCH). \\n\\nWatch this short clip to get an idea for blockstream\\'s profit model: \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/XD4LgWL09x4BTC is not trying to solve the problem.

Thus, having greater numbers of centralised hubs is not better in terms of financial security, it is actually much worse. This is why Lightning will ultimately centralise further and further. If there is any authority baked in at all, then people will tend to only want to trust the most central authorities. So if a currency technology itself is not fully trustless and without any authorities, or at least planning to get rid of any remaining authorities in the foreseeable future, then you might as well pack it in.Yes, and to me the most important point is that in 2016ish the Bitcoin Core GitHub repo was hijacked by Blockstream employees and associates.

This has been done by incremental discovery and removal of bottlenecks.  How far this approach can go remains to be seen, but it would definitely be possible to develop a new code base that is fully parallelizable.  We know what the actual performance of existing hardware is to perform the necessary communications, processing and database access required for each transaction, so it is just a matter of parallelizing these functions.  This can be done on a large server machine with hundreds of processor cores and a few dozen NVMe SSD disks, connected by a few gigabit Ethernet connections. Limitations of TCP performance can be circumventented by sharding transactions on to multiple connections based on TXID, similarly the blockchain database and UTXO database sharded similarly.   It would even be possible to build a scaled up (1000000 transactions per second) node out of a cluster of smaller systems, such as Raspberry Pi, interconnected by a switched LAN.\\n\\nThe problem is a chicken and egg problem, since investment in more performance is only useful if there is user demand and user demand is limited by lack of confidence in scalability.  The problem here is a business one, since it will take some millions of dollars to develop and demonstrate a fully scalable bitcoin network, but how to recover this investment in a open source world is questionable.\\n\\nThis could have been done at much lower cost than the investment in Blockstream, which seems to me and others to have been for the express purpose of blocking the scalability of bitcoin.Its at least 14x more space.  Sure, sometimes they would be full, but it wouldn\\'t be gridlock like it is now.   Bitcoin has a limited reach, with its use cases.  Some new ones will emerge from more space, but not infinitely.Please take this with ALL sincerity, seriously I swear I am not just \"making this up\" or repeating something I heard. Here is why we don\\'t need to limit the block size:\\n\\n1) (consumers): *Pruning* means that instead of holding the whole Blockchain you just hold the current balances, Satoshi himself outlined this and it is done successfully now in many projects to help scale already (e.g. Spv wallets). \\n\\n2) (miners/merchants): Satoshi ASSUMED blocks would never get full because he assumed that once fees got much above a penny the block size would be raised OR, for example, if there was a lot of spam miners might let blocks fill up and fees increase. BUT his fatal flaw was he thought miners would be rational and simply choose to keep fees low since the increase cost of storage space for them would be negligible.But this will make anyone with little mind make the bigger one work.Bad example. Cable is too centralized.    \\nEven if LN is not the best sollution it already gives x1000 scale.It\\'s not like I am trying to fix a sinking ship. For me it is enough that it works mathematically.   \\n\\nThere have been no LN stealing act. It is stupid to steal dust an get caught and lose all reputation. If someone will come up with a scheme where stealing in LN is profitable, someone will invent a punishment for that.No central authority is needed.    \\nMy app can check how old is this node by looking at transactions hystory and it can ask other nodes if they have any proof that this is a bad node. It is in everybody\\'s interest to keep this info.     \\nI can see how it will be harder for fresh nodes to enter the market, but they can offer free transactions for some period of time. I like free transactions. I bet there will be a solution where node gets punished hard when stealing. All we need is to wait for the first stealing act. There has been none so far.Mate, what is your vision for bitcoin?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1.Do you want it to be the global dominant decentralized currency that is used day to day by millions or billions of people? Do you want it to give economic identity to billions of people? Do you want it to replace cash? Do you want people to do as many transactions a day as they wish without having to worry about fees? Do you want it to be free of government control?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n2. Do you just want an improvement to the current bitcoin to support a few more transactions?So is there a testnet that demonstrated that it can handle 10k TPS and 100k TPS on reasonable hardware and completely decentralized and secure?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBecause what you are saying just sounds like theory, I need to see evidence of this to believe it.You are right that it was a bad example. But my point stands that something that requires as much attention to operate safely as does the Lightning Network is not really practical. And it puts more power in the hands of custodians who will take care of all those issues for you. It is trivially easy for a custodial database to scale, so crowing about scaling x1000 is inadvisable when you still have custodians in the picture, making it all possible. Lightning is not actually capable of onboarding everyone genuinely -- it would take more than 100 years to open that many Lightning channels. What would be impressive is scaling without trust, which is the goal the original Bitcoin shares with Bitcoin Cash. So BCH will continue to carry that torch while BTCers file into a technological cul-de-sac.I would like to see how far we can take it.  Currently, its pretty limited, but I would like to see many coins, but for bitcoin core, I would like to see it be for everyone.  Cheap tx, low fees and reliable, more privacy features.  I don\\'t think it will replace cash at this point, something like BCH could, locally, but it would need to be more privacy focused and faster.Actually I will recommend some people to use custodians. My wife for example. And all my coworkers. The general public can not be trusted with keeping the private key secure. Imagine a fool entering his seed phrases in a phishing web site. I will chose only the best custodian for my wife.\\n\\nIs BCH ready to onboard everybody today? I mean replace all creditcards. \"Get cable\" site says otherwise.  \\n\\nEthereum also is working on layer 2 solutions. And nobody can say that their whitepaper did not mention L2 and instead they must increase the block size. The creator is the one that is working on implementing the sharding and rollups.  \\n\\nLN is only the start. [And it will evolve](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pqepe4/a_scaling_breakthrough_for_the_lightning_network/).Ln doesn\\'t only have a bottleneck on chain. It can\\'t efficiently route funds. And muh decentralized chain depends on a few well connected hubs to get any tx throughput rather than changing a number... BeCaUsE HaRdFoRks break consensus. From a software engineering prospective, this was a terrible trade off in pragmatism vs complexity. LN will have to keep getting better... It can only get better. But while you\\'re fixing your eltoo, BCH will be eating your lunch.\\n\\nPlus, if BTC it committed to only soft fork upgrades, it\\'s only a matter of time until a bug shows in core and a HaRdFoRk is the only answer.

Yes, it seems that unless you\\'re willing to rely on a centralized LN services provider it\\'s just a terrible experience. Muun doesn\\'t even allow me to connect to my own node or control my channels. And it seems that with LN wallets, unlike on-chain wallets, one cannot simply move to a different app or provider with the same keys and continue using the same channel. Maybe it\\'s possible, but it doesn\\'t seem so. With BCH it\\'s easy to move a BIP39 mnemonic between wallets and services.This guy\\'s not just using the network, he\\'s running a node.Lol pretending to be a computer scientist to lie about NPYou couldn\\'t even read a full paragraph? It\\'s in the first one:\\n\\n> To send or receive payments via lightning, you need to have at least one payment channel that connects you to the network. Once a payment channel is opened, paying via lightning doesn\\'t require on-chain transactions. However, **opening and closing channels do require on-chain transactions, making these actions expensive and slow.**Every single time that BTC fails to clear its mempool in a single block is proof that there is demand for more throughput on the base layer.***\\nu/LovelyDayHere has [claimed](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/tx/6625dd00a4c0d818d6048b2f09e51f5908b7b6ebcff7e09842d7687c6e3b4362) the `0.0003 BCH` | `~0.19 USD` sent by u/bitmeister\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***Bullshit baffles brainsYeah he\\'s a silly LN hating troll hehePeople smarter than you can imagine are having a discussion you arent comprehending.

They don‚Äôt make on-chain BTC transactions to open LN channels unless they want to use Lightning. On-chain BTC fees vary quite a bit and tend to be pretty expensive vs. the competition. LN hasn‚Äôt solved this.There are test nets propagating 1GB blocks.LN runs countries and you\\'re a troll.What?[https://youtu.be/4Wu598ENenk](https://youtu.be/4Wu598ENenk)  \\n\\n\\nyou\\'re out of your elementThank-you.Didn\\'t Bitcoin Core insist on keeping the base block size cap at 1MB so people could run nodes? If you\\'re now telling me it\\'s unreasonable to expect users to run full nodes, then what the hell was the point!?Channel factories broAnd yet 4mb blocks can\\'t last a dayLol LN runs countries? \\n\\nEven with LN capacity going up almost 3x this year (while BTC on-chain volume is at a 5 year low), the high end of any volume estimates I have seen is still only a fraction of BCH volume.\\n\\nWhat country is running on LN? Andorra?Lol so wrong üòÇüòÇIt\\'s not unreasonable, it\\'s just more involved than using a walletWut?\\n\\nNormal people don\\'t want to care about complicated shit\\n\\nJust send moneyOn chain volume is lower because of off chain scaling lolThis guy\\'s not just using the network, he\\'s running a node.Yes, obviously that is a factor - as are the high fees that make it prohibitively expensive for the vast majority of humans on earth to transact in, as well as the rising success of other cryptocurrencies such as ETH. \\n\\nHowever, you have conveniently ignored my point - what country ‚Äúruns on LN‚Äù? \\n\\nEven the high estimates don‚Äôt indicate nearly enough activity on the LN to ‚Äúrun‚Äù even the smallest US state, much less a country.4 million El Salvadoreans so far have transacted on the LNI don‚Äôt buy that number for even 1 second. Thats 2/3 of the country lol. Got a source? The highest number I can find for active channels is about 70k. Only 29k active nodes. Only 200m in value locked. Thats child‚Äôs play at a national scale. I can find a mention that millions of El Salvadorians *downloaded* a lightning network capable app - but I think we can both agree that isn‚Äôt the same thing. \\n\\nThe average El Salvadorian lives off of 3500$ USD per year. \\n\\nIf you think most El Salvadorians are going to adopt a payment system that costs them between 1-3% of their yearly income in fees any time they want to put money into their account, you are sorely mistaken. \\n\\nRegardless, you were obviously just talking out of your ass, as El Salvador‚Äôs adoption of BTC - while promising - is still in its infancy, and LN certainly isn‚Äôt ‚Äúrunning the country‚Äù lol.Bro this has been all over the news for months. The government is giving them free walletsI am well aware? Did you read my last comment?\\n\\nMillions downloading a free wallet =/= millions transacting on the lightning network. Anyone can see the official LN numbers, and they are no where near millions of users. \\n\\nLook - I own *plenty* of BTC. In fact, I‚Äôd be willing to bet a few BTC that I own a lot more than you lol. \\n\\nI will cheer on it‚Äôs success, even if I disagree with it‚Äôs change in course since I first bought in. If LN succeeds at bringing value to BTC, I am all for it. \\n\\nI am not one of those ‚Äúfuck BTC go BCH‚Äù at all costs maximalists. There is plenty of room in my portfolio - and the world - for both. \\n\\nBut you made a pretty bold claim, and I wanted to get the bottom of it. Which I have.\\n\\nCheers>Anyone can see the official LN numbers, and they are no where near millions of users. \\n\\nUsers can share channels and nodes sillyAgain, I am well aware, but your point is?\\n\\nTotal value locked in the entire network is still a small fraction of even the GDP of El Salvador.GDP isn\\'t exactly relatable to buying gas and groceries lol\\n\\nLearn some economics scrubIt‚Äôs an easy to reference metric for the amount of economic activity in the country - even if all of the lightning network capacity was El Salvadorians, it‚Äôs still only a fraction of the country‚Äôs economic activity lol.\\n\\nIe your claim that the country ‚Äúruns on lightning network‚Äù is bogus.Millions of people on it lolMillions of wallets‚Ä¶ just no one actually using them lol. \\n\\nMaybe in a decade. As I said, I am not some zealot either way. Would love to see LN succeed, but you are just spouting nonsense.Millions of active users disagree with you lolCan confirm. Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, and the rest of Blockstream have not only been a disgrace to crypto, but a detriment to it, destroying it from within.I\\'m sorry, those laser eyes are dumb. I have a hard time taking anyone seriously with laser eyes in their profile.> Back: ...Not messing around with ~~hypercube sharding~~ **SegWit, RbF, LN,** blah blah. More focused...\\n\\nFixed that for him.Source https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1451714790385090560?s=21Apparently has the mechanics of a short squeeze backwards somehow?I blame Satoshi for mentioning him in the Bitcoin paper. üò†He clearly wants to suppress cryptocurrenciesIt\\'s interesting how stupid smart people can end up being, and how stupid people can have moments of divine revelation.Big blocks are bad but somehow fat nodes are good.The threat brought by ETH against BTC cannot be underestimated. ETH is at the blink of flippening BTC and if that great flippening happens, then BCH will be noticed again and BCH may be the next crypto to flippen BTC after ETH, and then BTC will die. ETH is the most important ally of BCH in the competition (not war) against BTC.\\n\\nAdam Back knows it and he feels being threatened. He hates ETH but he has nothing to do. He wants to use SOL as a tool to distract the attention of public from ETH, but it will not work. It is very possible that within next 6-18 months, ETH will be the No.1 market cap, and then BCH will have a 100x increase in price, and BTC falls.Midwit Twitter trolls don‚Äôt have legacies.He was also encouraging his followers to launder money the other day. His words were quite literally illegal. I‚Äôm also lost with this guy that he‚Äôs mentioned in the bitcoin white paper. I suppose that‚Äôs all you need to know isn‚Äôt it really, don‚Äôt trust the bloke!I think he is Satoshi and he is just a BTC maxi, for obvious reasons.Oh don‚Äôt be full of yourself lol POWBois shitting on Sharders shitting on DPOStakers ‚Ä¶. Everyone is a hypocrite and thus a disgraceHe is Just another insecure maxi, albeit a maxi that wrote the white paper.Yes. Lazer eyes is the defacto retard-indicator.They aren\\'t \\'laser eyes\\'. They are wounds caused by having their souls sucked out through their ocular cavities.he\\'s a cryptographerReportedReportedReportedI like how the government pretends these fucking tech companies don‚Äôt already have basically 100% control of what the majority of Americans see and think about on a daily basis but they don‚Äôt have to pay taxes equal to that massive fucking amount of representation they haveIt\\'s not gonna succeed anyway.Is it shit? Yes\\n\\nShould they be allowed to create shit projects? Also yesNeither can the US but here we are.Stillborn project. If they already manipulate your data for a profit...Karma is a bitch huh, Zuckerzuck.xdddddddddd.he gets his lesson.also ironic because the government can\\'t be trusted to manage the money supply either.Lots of reasons but many come back to the successful propaganda campaign (BCash) that labeled BCH as a scam coin.Simply üíé üñê....easy to hold when it‚Äôs hard to spend.\\n\\nBCH is the oppositeBCH is one of the most hated-upon cryptos since it competes _directly_ for mining hashpower and \\'Bitcoin\\' name recognition with BTC.\\n\\nIn fact, BTC is hardly a peer to peer cash system anymore.\\n\\nThere are big market makers trying to suppress the BCH price, but it has broken out before and could do so again.\\n\\nI treat the low price as an opportunity.Because, Bitcoin Maxis that\\'s whyPrice manipulation.  And an army of trolls as evidenced in the comments here.Other main cryptos? Doge is not a main crypto. Its only exists because idiots exist.It‚Äôs up 5% in the last few hours.Bitcoin cash is little brother.My gut feeling says that there is naked short selling going on against BCH since months. Connected / supported with the Tether scam.I think it\\'s because of the low fees. BCH doesn\\'t have full blocks so it can\\'t get surges in demand, it\\'s never illiquid. And it can\\'t compete on the meme layer since it\\'s looks like a knock off of btc. When BCH lost the battle over the btc name it should have changed to something else(at this point it\\'s not worth it).\\n\\nBut because it has low fees, it can be used by really poor people in ways that the other coins can\\'t. Don\\'t worry about competing in the US, focus on South America, Southeast Asia, and Africa. BCH can become the currency of the very poor and increase the standard of living to a lot of people.The BSV and eCash splits didn\\'t helpDoge is not a main crypto lmaoIf crypto succeeds for anything other than speculation, then BCH is the winner.I always ask myself a mirroring question, Why is BTC going up? Has it gain more adoption? Have fees gone down? Are people actually using it? Have it had a major feature released? \\n\\nMost of the time the answer is no, so it‚Äôs just speculation so that is irrelevant for me, magic number. \\n\\nI‚Äôm interested on a Revolution not a tickerbtc = THE COMPLICATED CONVERTING IT BACK INTO FIAT BANKSTER COIN.BCH IS FREEDOM, lots of people are scared and wanna stick to their bank btc . They dont want control their own money.because it\\'s scam, it only exists as an alleged BTC alternative but never made it and probably never will>Why does BCH still remain low while the other main crytpos such as ETH, BTC & DOGE rally up in price?\\n\\nIt is because BCH supporters do not encourage currency traders to participate in BCH trading pair markets. This was an early on trend that has stuck around until this day.\\n\\nThe result is less & less participating traders for BCH trading pairs leading to a feedback loop. Less profits from BCH trading are being reintroduced to BCH to purchase at lower levels during market downturns. \\n\\nMore lucrative choices are available and this leads to even less traders/money available money for BCH markets. \\n\\nBut the worst part of this is how people turn to conspiratorial explanations for the poor performance, rather then recognizing the deficiency.It‚Äôs a free market with no government intervention, so the market chooses its winners and losers. Yes, It‚Äôs that easy.BCH had been up more than BTC today,  sounds good to me.  If mass adoption hits, I expect BCH to go along with it.Because it\\'s an insecure minority fork of Bitcoin kept alive only through an intentionally broken Difficulty Adjustment Algo and centralising checkpoints.\\n\\nIt will continue to trend towards 0BTC.Litecoin up 12% in 24hrs.It‚Äôs just lagging behind the others, smart money has already sold their positions and put it in coins that are still low and lagging behind the other like bch, xrp, zcash and dash. \\nThe alt coins start to pump when bitcoin ends it‚Äôs bull run. We will see bch, zcash, litcoin, and others pump as bitcoin and eth dump and retrace back to it‚Äôs highs.Because BCH seems a little scammy when they claim it\\'s the true Bitcoin.There is a big red flag for bch: during the last bullrun it was not able to surpass its ath by a huge margin‚Ä¶\\n\\nAnother point is that investors prefer more modern stuff defi related‚Ä¶ just a currency feels outdatedBch is like a duck, it\\'s not the best at anythingWhat are you talking about?  \\nLast Hour:  \\nBCH up 0.25%  \\nBTC down 0.64%  \\nETH down 0.14%  \\nDOGE up 0.18%\\n\\nLast Day:  \\nBCH up 5.78%  \\nBTC up 4.47%  \\nETH up 6.5%  \\nDOGE up 2.83%\\n\\nLast Week:  \\nBCH up 10.05%  \\nBTC up 16.42%  \\nETH up 16.25%  \\nDOGE up 11.53%Because it\\'s a shitcoin, a fork of bitcoin started by Bitmain, with some knobs and whistles tacked on.  And the shitlords here spent so long attacking bitcoin, nobody other than fellow koolaid drinkers is going to to take them seriously.\\n\\nRight now there\\'s a ton of chains competing for \"world computer\" status. Bitcoin captured the SoV/P2P cash market, there is no competition for this any more. Which is why people are tacking on things like smartbch to bcash, which is a nice idea, but you\\'re competing with a ton of other projects that are literally paying people to use them.\\n\\nSo it\\'s a spare hammer, nobody has a use for it when you have a perfectly good one in your toolbox.Change your f*cking branding. \"Bitcoin Cash\" will never sell.Because BCH is trashBecause its trash, my guy.Just a shit  altcoin Ôºåwu  sold  all last  bull marketBecause the issue has been settled and it\\'s now irrelevant.Holy shit all these comments blaming literally any possible thing but the coin itself. Couldn‚Äôt conceivably be that it simply doesn‚Äôt have a place in the marketBitcoin cash is the super shit coinIt‚Äôs fake goldConsider it a blessing you can accumulate moreEach has a different use case. BTC is a settlement system. BCH and DASH are currencies. Ethereum is programmatic. DOGE is an in-joke.\\n\\nThe market for a permissionless censorship-free settlement system is making good progress.\\n\\nThe market for a worldwide currency hasn\\'t even started properly yet.Why would it matter? BCH is a spending currency so it makes sense that it is far less volatile. I wouldn‚Äôt spent a currency that jumps 10% in price each day. It would make me regret buying something yesterday when I could have waited until today to buy it for cheaper.Because eth,BTC and doge are all favored and pumped by counterfeit fiat (USDT).\\n\\nIdiots see BTC and the other shitcoins rally and go on markets to buy these with real money, enabling the group of scammers behind USDT to exit to real fiat.\\n\\np2p money goes against the financial status quo, so this is why BCH and XMR are heavily suppressed today.Two coins are not constantly pumped by TPTW.\\n\\nMonero and Bitcoin Cash. Do you need more information than that?Yes this is the question I wanted an answer for!\\nBut for me BTC was, is and will always be the King and the father of all cryptocurrencies üëë\\nI believe nothing will ever beat BTC.Presumably Tether.Because everything that BTC can do, other coins can do better. BTC is big because it has major first mover advantage. When people think of cryptocurrency, they think of Bitcoin.\\n\\nBCH is the exact same thing as BTC with a minor adjustment that allows for quicker/cheaper transactions. So basically, it‚Äôs the exact same thing as BTC but without the first mover advantage.\\n\\nI hold BCH. But don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking that someday BCH will flip BTC and that it is superior to BTC in every way. It won‚Äôt. And it isn‚Äôt.The market is still very under-informed regarding this new tech.  Bitcoin is a superior payment system to what we\\'ve been using.  And, using bitcoin can eliminate the need for auditing and auditors, including official auditors.  Just think about that.  The buying mania is the intellectual diversion preventing the marketplace from understanding what they have: a very fast and easy triple-entry accounting system that is resilient and decentralized.  I.e. less a way to make dollars, more a way to avoid dollars.I believe it\\'ll boost after few days, waiting for it since a long time tho.StoryToken.app is on üî•!!

I mean the whole talk is about its use not its price? If it goes up so much it may limit accessibility?There is still some shit coin that hadn\\'t shown any pump as the BTC had shown.BCH has a supply cap of 21 million as well. People just need to hold what they got and buy when they need to spend BCH.I think this is an important point. No other crypto has as much of a chance as being a existential threat to BTC as BCH. If adoption increases, price increases, hashpower/mining switches over, where does that leave BTC?Why would anyone choose to mine BCH instead of BTC?\\n\\nSeems like BTC is more profitable> There are big market makers trying to suppress the BCH price\\n\\nThat\\'s Jihan Wu and Roger Ver selling you their bags and nothing more.\\n\\nIt will always trend towards zero.My BCH is not growing like the other coins‚Ä¶.wow!

I don\\'t think I grasp the concept of naked short selling, especially how one could do it in cryptoCan you take a moment explain to me like I am 10 how this works? Or point me in the direction where I can understand what you‚Äôre saying here? How would someone go about shorting bitcoin cash. Where would this be done?Months? Would rather say years...LOL!!!So u/chaintipOf course there is naked short selling.. this is crypto. Deposit btc/eth/usd/etc and borrow BCH then sell it.Serving the poor is the key.This is the correct answer. Rampant speculation for bcore.I agree with you. I have done my best to help create a BCH ecosystem where exchanges that have BCH as a base pair are connected  with other exchanges. Finally now we have a BCH friendly stablecoin with flexUSD. And on SmartBCH, everything is traded against BCH.  We just need to disconnect our system from the bigger Tether system and move more and more BCH to our system where Tether can not manipulate it easily.\\n\\n>But the worst part of this is how people turn to conspiratorial explanations for the poor performance, rather then recognizing the deficiency.\\n\\nIt is a combination. Everybody knows that Tether can print whatever they want and buy whatever they want and everybody closes a eye to it. (they can also short whatever they want). \\n\\nTether won\\'t last forever and neither will the speculation driven market, it\\'s going to run out of speculators with fresh new money eventually and then either it becomes utility driven or it just dies.>It is because BCH supporters do not encourage currency traders to participate in BCH trading pair markets. This was an early on trend that has stuck around until this day.  \\n>  \\n>The result is less & less participating traders for BCH trading pairs leading to a feeback loop. Less profits from BCH trading are being reintroduced to BCH to purchase at lower levels during market downturns.\\n\\nThat\\'s interesting, it would seem like this would hurt price.  Though I\\'m not sure how it could have been avoided then or how it could be fixed now.  Back then most exchanges were just tolerating BCH and weren\\'t interested in supporting base pairs.  And now, creating base pairs doesn\\'t mean traders will come.  I\\'ve seen some exchanges with BCH base pairs and the market is dead.  Do you see a way that BCH pairs are traded?Let\\'s watch and see whether market adoption of real money in daily commerce ever results from enabling currency exchanges.  It will be an interesting thing to add to the history books.\\n\\nOn using the word conspiratorial as you do... It\\'s misleading to automatically discredit all people who are working together.   That turns all of the conversation which follows into a limited hangout.  Why do that?  We (you and me) are conspiring here on this subreddit, we don\\'t start our conversation by denying that.  I think it\\'s equally important to note that certain central banks are not audited, and that within their territories they can have absolute financial power.  I\\'d even say that throughout the existence of central banks, and up until recently, they\\'ve proven to be highly conspiratorial in their nature.Then short it you moron!>kept alive only through an intentionally broken Difficulty Adjustment Algo\\n\\nEvery engineer/scientist with a tiny bit of knowledge in control systems will tell you satoshis algo was laughably bad and BCHs is much better.You don\\'t call an orange scammy because ot calls itself a fruit just like the apple does. \\n\\nBCH is as much bitcoin as BTC if you check the whitepaper it is arguable closer to the idea of satoshi.We don\\'t claim anything. BTC says they are now gold and not currency or a payment network. That means BTC says they are not Bitcoin.Exactly. The market has already chosen.

Some might even think Satoshi chose his ‚Äúlaughably bad‚Äù approach because it makes persistent minority forks unworkable.Whatever you say.This is correct take.ExactlyDoesn‚Äôt matter when you bought in at 9k :)\\nPlus, I held BCH when I bought Bitcoin. Then I got a brain and sold it for ETH when it was around $300-400. I‚Äôd say i made a better financial choice than picking up more BCH that performs like dog shitHaha wow.. thank you for this. You really do fit exactly the picture of this sub.\\n\\nI left a thoughtful comment with my legitimate opinions and you reply with telling me I‚Äôm wrong but won‚Äôt provide any info as to why.\\n\\nYou‚Äôre ridiculous. Laughable!Well adoption is a very important metric when comparing different cryptos against each other. When comparing BCH vs fiat I would prioritize more the decentralized deflationary low fee peer to peer instant 0conf nature of it.the market is saying otherwise. \\n\\nbad answer anyway as BCH is also developling 2nd layer (smart bch) to confront issues with single layer blockchain tech. Zoom out and its just tribal. The crowd is choosing its winners and losers and we can see it in adoption rates. As an investor choose wisely\\n\\nbest of luckEthereum is gas for a smart contract platform. It‚Äôs not designed to be sound money. Bitcoin Cash is.Or safe up BCH and long it then use on of the weaknesses of BTC to destroy it while shorting BTC.\\n\\nFor instance fee attacks on BTC are really easy, you could push fees past 100 dollars per tx no problem with less than 100 BTC of captital.  Completely grinds the Lightning Network to a halt.> But bch loses value to bitcoin every year consistently.\\n\\nSo its price was suppressed by fraud and you come here saying that it loses value to BTC which is not suitable for any real economic activity.\\n\\nPlease go and fuck yourself.Yes, of course.  My portfolio is 99% BTC and I have no intention to change that.  I just keep some BCH for fun.That would be the best moveLol do you know how conversion rates work. Best move is to mine btc and convert to BCH since it\\'s cheaper.Miners **not** wanting BCH to survive is irrational. It\\'s a backup economical design in case BTC\\'s chosen path fails. If there were no backup to migrate to then miners income would suddenly end, and all their mining hardware would be turned into scrap metal overnight.\\n\\nThis has been proven multiple times now - big miners switch hashpower to BCH and mine at a loss during major events (BSV fork, segwit coins steal attempt) to preserve BCH. Obviously being the majority chain would be a better position, but those miners still follow the money which is currently to mine BTC. The point however is that they are watching, and have defended BCH and will do so again.\\n\\nWhy? Because the BTC economics are broken. They don\\'t work long-term. Simply extrapolate out the years and the numbers don\\'t add up. BTC is a ticking timebomb, and miners know this.\\n\\nAs for block times, do you not remember BTC recently losing ~50% of its hashrate, blocktimes averaging over 20mins, and fees averaging over $50 yet again? BCH wouldn\\'t have performed so poorly under the same circumstances. :)It is actually true BTCs algo is pretty bad.

I think that the big factor in ticker assignment wasn\\'t \"fairness\" though, it was really that Bitmain and some other miners who supported the fork, did have minority hashrate, and none of them really wanted to throw the whole market into chaos by uncertainty on putting the ticker of BTC (#1 coin back then too) in question.\\n\\nThe market just didn\\'t have the stomach for that kind of disruption.\\n\\nI am a bit sour about exchanges dropping the insistence on replay protection for later forks against BCH, when they insisted on it for the BTC/BCH split out of the legit reason to protect users from replay attacks.\\n\\nUnfortunately I think the centralized exchange landscape has shifted substantially against favor of BCH, with the rise of Binance. There seems to be some longstanding animosity there against BCH, manifesting also in biases on coin ranking sites, which isn\\'t resolved yet.> the \"Bitcoin Core\" side of the split was bestowed the BTC name as a *fait accompli* by a small group of industry insiders\\n\\nUncomfortable truth: one of these insiders was Jihan Wu\\n\\nTake from that what you will.Yes üëç Saved for future referenceIt was not a fair competition for many reasons (lies, censorship, bribery, ...), but if I am not mistaken: had the majority of mining hash moved to BCH we would have captured the name and adoption Bitcoin had developed up to that point. The ticker would be ours if we had had the hash rate. So, the ticker did follow the hash rate.\\n\\nUsually the hash follows the price. So, the ticker follows the price. That said, I still think \"the BTC ticker followed the hashrate\".\\n\\nIf I am mistaken, I do not see why yet.\\n\\nEdit: Maybe what you are trying to say is something about how it was not fair. Maybe something like \\'debunking the myth BCH lost the ticker in a fair competition for hash rate\\'?Actually, I\\'m not bitter at all about the BCH/BTC ticker thing. I think even if the hash rate favored Bitcoin Cash and there was a legit Flippening, exchanges probably would have kept BCH as the ticker, and just put it at the top of the list. That\\'s more important. This crypto space moves fast, nobody outside of you-know-where would have cared if the top spot changed names, as long as they could still trade it with volume.\\n\\nNow, I am salty about the exchanges who said \"hey. This thing calls itself BitCoin Cash, it\\'s ticker should be BCC\" -- those were intentionally trying to conflate it with BitconeeeeeectFor completeness, it also didn‚Äôt happen with Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond.\\n\\nOne can discuss whether the BTC/BCH split was more like the BCH/BSV split or like the BTC/BTG split.They also ensured this by stringing people along with the New York Agreement to hard fork a larger base block size in September 2017 and only started fighting (after it was supposedly ‚Äúlocked in‚Äù) after the BCH split. At the time, I didn‚Äôt sell my BCH because I was hedging, but I was still mostly onboard with BTC under the assumption they would actually do what they had committed to doing.So what can bch do about it? Live in a cocoon thinking you can still flip BTC? Does this sub really think that is even imaginable now?We will get to see if og Bitcoin is strong enough to survive a name hijack or if it has irrevocably devolved into a hub and spoke network that will disintegrate in a generation or two.Generally agree, and I was around for both BTC/BCH and BCH/BCHA splits. (I missed the actual one in the middle but was around for the some of the conflicts that led up to the BSV split.) One thing I would like to point out is that not every exchange used the \\'BCHN\\' ticker, and in fact, some exchanges announced before the fork that the BCH ticker would remain with BCHN, regardless.\\n\\nNot that it affects the point you\\'re making, but I don\\'t think exchanges feel bound at all to even consider relative hashrates when assigning tickers, and have only claimed to do so at certain times in order to acquire the appearance of fairness.>Every so often I see this claim that the small-block version of Bitcoin retained the ticker because it had majority hashrate.\\n\\nThey were not given the ticker or anything like that. The software used by exchanges to receive bitcoin (to be credited on the exchange) was unchanged. <--- this is why bitcoin kept the BTC ticker, because it follows the bitcoin network & all the valid rules associated with the network.\\n\\nIn order to deposit BCH on an exchange, that exchange had to download/compile new software changes, largely similar to actual bitcoin but with specific changes that make the software incomparable with the actual bitcoin network.\\n\\n>This is a major misconception that needs to die in a fire.\\n\\n>There was never, ever, a \"market vote\" on BCH vs BTC.\\n\\nThe vote took place Aug 1, 2017 1:23 PM UTC in block 478559.In my memory the August 2017 environment was different: Nobody asked whether Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash will get the BTC ticker. It was clear to everybody besides the BCH apologists that BCH was a minority fork and the main question was will BCH survive its first months in any useable state at all. Bitmain made it survive by donating huge hashrate at a loss while not selling any coins and only then big exchanges started to add BCH support one by one.\\n\\nEg Coinbase, a known big block supporter, hesitated to add BCH at first:\\n\\n[https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdf](https://blog.coinbase.com/update-on-bitcoin-cash-8a67a7e8dbdf)\\n\\nand added it 5 months later:\\n\\n[https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b](https://blog.coinbase.com/buy-sell-send-and-receive-bitcoin-cash-on-coinbase-65f1b2c7214b)\\n\\nThen there was Segwit2X on the horizon which was the designated BTC network according to the New York Agreement so I guess exchanges would give it the BTC ticker if any.\\n\\nHowever, Segwit2X was a big failure and only after that the main exchangest started to look into integrating Bitcoin cash which was running as BCC and BCH at smaller exchanges at that time and the bigger ones made its ticker settle as BCH.Bitcoin Cash was the one that hard forked and dubbed itself such, and it was BCC not BCH at the time, many days after the fork even Roger Ver was calling it this. Despite this there was still a market vote on whether Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin core, BCC or BTC would retain the value and the \\'Bitcoin\\' name, the \\'slur\\' at the time was bcash (dropping bitcoin from the name entirely to try and remove its claim to Bitcoin), you either weren\\'t there or have a terrible memory. BCC was the one that hard forked and was the one that was had delayed trading/deposits/withdrawals because devs needed to sort out wallets and replay protection. The market decided which Bitcoin, was going to be just \\'Bitcoin\\', not \\'Bitcoin core\\' or \\'Bitcoin cash\\'.Wrong. There doesn\\'t need to be a \"fair market vote\".\\n\\nNakamoto Consensus chose the BTC chain. That is the uncomfortable truth that a lot of people here seem to have a problem with accepting. If you do not agree with this consensus mechanism, you do not agree with Satoshi\\'s design.\\n\\nThe miners had every power to push a 2MB upgrade, but they didn\\'t... and BCH is ultimately the result of that.\\n\\nAnd no, I\\'m not a BTC maxi. I\\'ve been apart of this community since the original fork.Lol bro, you\\'re such a fucking weasel.\\n\\nThe \"Bitcoin ticker\" was never in dispute, because when BCH forked off, the original coin was still present and unchanged.\\n\\nIf you were running a node from say 2015/6 *well before the fork was even decided*, then come the 1st of August 2017, you *were* on the Bitcoin chain, that is undisputed.  This is literally how everyone else (clearly not the clowns here) saw it when it happened, people, companies, exchanges, all had infrastructure setup, and things *worked*.  Nobody needed to change any anything including tickers because everything was already setup and working.\\n\\nWhen BCH turned up, a bunch of people created a *brand new repo*, by a *completely different set of people,* and you had to download *new incompatible software*, and all along, the Bitcoin network just carried on blockin\\', every 10 minutes, with no change other than hashpower shifting about a bit.  You\\'re really a smoothbrain if you think that everyone will go rename the thing that exists and hasn\\'t changed, because some other new thing turns up and says it\\'s the \"real\" first thing, even though the original thing is still unchanged.\\n\\nThe SV split was *always* contentious, and both chains forked at the same time, so it was an equal split (remember the hashpower wars, ahh, good times, thanks Jihan and Calvin for wasting millions of dollars!), and there was no clear consensus over which was the real bitcoin cash because unlike before, you couldn\\'t just run the old software and carry on validating either chain.\\n\\nSame with ABC, there was an internal conflict and two competing and incompatible changes were proposed, and come the day of the fork, both camps had to duke it out for the dust to settle.\\n\\nYou know, this, and you still try to squirm around the fact that BCH is a fork, and it needed to be named *something else.* The SV and ABC splits were different to the original split, and you know it, but you still try to gloss over it.\\n\\nBitcoin is back up near ATH, and all you do is whine, you could have been along for the ride, instead you went your own way.  And now you\\'re trying to justify it because you see Bitcoin hit ATH, and BCH was what $1600?  Bitcoin then went down by like 1/2 to $30k, it\\'s now been on another bull run to >$60k, and BCH has managed what in that time, $800? You\\'re like the jealous ex who sees how well their ex partner is doing without them.\\n\\nTether! Blorgstream! Illuminati! waaa waaa, this sub is a broken record that can\\'t get past backing the wrong horse.  You can sit here with the other inmates singing \"Kum ba yah\", but look around outside this sub, nobody gives a shit, you\\'re a laughing stock, and the sooner you wake up and smell the roses, the better.Right. You are telling the truth.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is counter-intuitive and it is easier to say \"markets spoke, BCH lost\". Which is a lie.\\n\\nBTC was captured by central devs. And the miners did not make a \"defense by hashwar\". That\\'s all.\\n\\n\\\\> TLDR: there has never been a fair market vote on \"which is the real Bitcoin\"\\n\\nIt never happened and it never will. The markets have no executive power over the blockchain. Simply put, the market mechanism is useless for decision making. No NASDAQ company uses the stock market to make decisions. A CEO or board does. An executive power.\\n\\nIn the Bitcoin project that\\'s the hashpower exactly, literally. Legitimately. Decentrally.\\n\\nThe whitepaper makes that very clear. They vote... with hashpower. And the rules and incentives must be ENFORCED with this mechanism (by hashwar, to preserve the original ticker).\\n\\nAnd that vote did happen. Twice with hashpower majority.\\n\\n1. 71% BIP100 (dynamic block size)\\n2. 94% NYA (2MB block size)\\n\\n[Nakamoto.observer/signals](https://nakamoto.observer/signals)I will be happy to volunteer some of my working with you .I wasn\\'t here in 2017, so I\\'m curious about something. Let\\'s say I had a Bitcoin wallet like Electrum back from before the split. Right after the split, would it have read off the BTC blockchain or the BCH blockchain?Future markets that almost nobody used.\\n\\nThe reality is that censorship, lies and smear campaigns worked because majority of the participants either didn‚Äôt have any clue or were blinded by greed.The futures had shit conditions designed to screw big blockers no matter what. Not fair at all.This is insightful and I\\'ll also agree that it was a different time back then.\\n\\nBut futures markets are easier to game and were limited to a few exchanges.\\n\\nWhich is why when BSV and ABC both split, the decision wasn\\'t left to futures markets but the actual market of coin holders.\\n\\nMy point stands: the decision was not based on hashrate or an actual full-market decision as many try to claim.there is so much bias that I am beginning to suspect that exchanges are just picking their shitcoins and going through hell to back them no matter what. When you see big whale buys its exchanges buying up loads to dump on their customers. My opinion.>it was really that Bitmain and some other miners who supported the fork, did have minority hashrate, and none of them really wanted to throw the whole market into chaos by uncertainty on putting the ticker of BTC (#1 coin back then too) in question.\\n\\nThis is how I remember it too.It must be good for the next few years, this is a mustI think things would\\'ve looked a LOT different if the Bitmain IPO hadn\\'t been shot down.\\n\\nOne has to admit that mining & holding on to an enormous amount of BCH for a long time after the fork, does show immense hope that Jihan pinned on this fork. But I think he got ambushed in the market by USDT.\\n\\nIf Jihan wrote a book (or even a thorough article) about all the events that followed the Bitcoin Cash fork, I think that would be interesting.\\n\\nBut it seems he is focused on Matrixport and doesn\\'t care to shed light on that history right now.Truth>if I am not mistaken: had the majority of mining hash moved to BCH we would have captured the name and adoption\\n\\nI believe you are mistaken, but even if you\\'re correct and a plurality of exchanges would have renamed and relabeled the two sides of the fork, this would have required BCH overtaking BTC **despite** BTC already \"being Bitcoin\" in name and ticker and BCH an \"altcoin\" in name and ticker -- a practically impossible task considering the information level of the typical retail investor.It always seemed too convenient that Tether supported btc price rises at the most convenient of times.> The ticker would be ours if we had had the hash rate. So, the ticker did follow the hash rate.\\n\\nI ~~agree.~~ think it would have been the name recognition of what makes \\'Bitcoin\\', not necessarily the ticker.\\nPeople would understand that a ticker doesn\\'t represent the principles, necessarily.\\n\\nThe hash rate was bought out with BTC price increases through Tether pumps.\\n\\nThe 2017 EOY pump fueled by Tether was the reaction to keep BCH down.\\n>I think even if the hash rate favored Bitcoin Cash and there was a legit Flippening, exchanges probably would have kept BCH as the ticker, and just put it at the top of the list.\\n\\nThe point is that by pre-defining BCH as a \"not-Bitcoin altcoin\" the exchanges made this vastly less likely.It was unlike either.>I don\\'t think exchanges feel bound at all to even consider relative hashrates when assigning tickers, and have only claimed to do so at certain times in order to acquire the appearance of fairness.\\n\\nOr to try to impact the outcome in a way they prefer. Choosing a name in advance of the fork is a way to influence the outcome.\\n\\nAfter the hash rate settles on one fork as the winner, they may not be bound to give the winner the original ticker, but I think they always do.>Nobody asked whether Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash will get the BTC ticker.\\n\\nOn this we agree. That\\'s kinda the point.>Nakamoto Consensus chose the BTC chain.\\n\\nThis is incorrect. Nakamoto consensus can only \"choose\" which of two chains **using the same set of compatible rules** is valid. Once replay protection was added to BCH, Nakamoto consensus had nothing more to say on the issue.\\n\\nMiners don\\'t choose the rules. Miners follow the rules created by devs. Markets give value to the rules by holding or selling coins created by the rules.Well at least you have the intellectual honesty to admit that \"Bitcoin\" is synonymous with \"Bitcoin Core,\" a centralized project that can change any feature of Bitcoin that it wants, even the 21M limit, and the coin will always be called \"Bitcoin\" because it\\'s basically a corporation at this point.\\n\\nGood on you. I knew you\\'d get there. üëçDo not use this sub to ask for money. See the rules in the sidebar.BTC.\\n\\nLike any other upgraded software, BCH needs upgraded clients in order to work. If you don\\'t upgrade, you stay on the old version.Don\\'t forget also that miners were still operating under the conditions of the [Hong Kong Agreement](https://medium.com/@bitcoinroundtable/bitcoin-roundtable-consensus-266d475a61ff) wherein Adam Back convinced most of the sha256 hashpower to commit to run ONLY Bitcoin Core software and no others.> My point stands: the decision was not based on hashrate or an actual full-market decision as many try to claim.\\n\\nSpecifically, miners aligned with bscore in 2015 (hk roundtabke agreement, and the markets were subverted through usdt.> My point stands: the decision was not based on hashrate or an actual full-market decision as many try to claim.\\n\\nRetrospectively, I do agree, perhaps a less gentlemanly split would\\'ve worked out better - but who knows. In this case I don\\'t even think hindsight is 20/20.\\n\\nBut I do think it is useless to complain about perceived unfairness now.\\n\\nBitcoin Cash is hella resilient, and it has a growing community of users who realize that it is the real working peer to peer cash system, without [the snags of the others](https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qabqlg/why_isnt_bitcoin_cash_just_called_bitcoin/hh2tpp8/).If coin holders were ultimately the deciding factor it would seem that governance is working as intended.>One has to admit that mining & holding on to an enormous amount of BCH for a long time after the fork, does show immense hope that Jihan pinned on this fork.\\n\\nI agree. I don\\'t see Jihan as an enemy of BCH, that\\'s for sure. My assumption is that he was trying to walk a politically correct line. The dude suffered an ungodly amount of abuse, both before and after.\\n\\nOne of the problems the big blockers have always had is an overall notion of trying to solve problems with reason and attempts at fair play, while the other side unabashedly wages unfettered war.  Big blockers keep bringing a pot of coffee and good intentions to a street fight.You are very knowledgeable about these subjects. Interesting point, I dont think anyone could have predicted how bitcoin mining shifted from east to west.Exactly, add to this that blockstream an Tether are connected you get a good picture of what happened.Theres even more sticky connections to the defaulting right now in china property market, conveniently bitcoin price shoots up when ever-grande has to make bond payments.I think you might mean BTC-Core price rises.Perhaps there is a third variable - social popularity - that affects both hashrate and decision-making at exchanges, causing them to be correlated without direct causation. It would be interesting to see what would happen at exchanges if there were ever a contentious fork with most of the hashrate on one side but most of the social popularity on the other side.Miners were able to hashwar with empty blocks + reorg temporarily until the original ticker was preserved.\\n\\nThey were able to organize it.\\n\\nThey came close to doing it. They put 100 million on the table.\\n\\nBut they didn\\'t.\\n\\nSo, in the face of the miners\\' inaction... then others (central devs) control Bitcoin.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s the whole story.My purpose here is not to complain about past wrongs **but to ensure that the history is correctly documented.**>If coin holders were ultimately the deciding factor\\n\\nFor BCHABC/BCHSV yes\\n\\nFor BCHA/BCHN yes\\n\\nFor BCH/BTC no> One of the problems the big blockers have always had is an overall notion of trying to solve problems with reason and attempts at fair play, while the other side unabashedly wages unfettered war.

But catastrophic collapse scenarios seem to remain in play, both for Tether as for bigshot fiat currencies.I would fuck someone up with a pot of coffee and some good intentions. You have no clue how much harm can be done with good intentions alone.üëÜüëÜüëÜ>a third variable - social popularity\\n\\nFor which there is no Sybil resistance whatsoeverI have also been interested in documenting history to the best of my knowledge.  I invite you to message me for this purpose at any point in the future and I will be happy to volunteer some of my working with you on this effort to document and preserve this history rapidly passing us by.After making this post I read more clearly and understand the differences now. Even though I lived through it as a miner, if you were not really concerned most of the details were handled far above your head. I vaguely understood what was happening at the time but never had the interest I do now. Thanks for taking time to detail your thoughts in this thread.Right!?\\n\\n1. Print fake unbacked dollar called a USDT\\n\\n2. Buy BTC with USDT\\n\\n3. USDT now backed by BTC\\n\\n4. BTC price goes up\\n\\n5. Claim \"The market decided!\"\\n\\n6. ????\\n\\n7. üí•\\n\\n8. ????I hate to say it but bitcoin has lost one cpu one vote. Asics are not decentralized. Dont shoot the messenger. I have wondered, however, if some genius will invent a more powerful gpu miner for sha256 that can do more processing than an asic, or compete in some meaningful way. Maybe a layer 2 that adds monero mining, that would really be interesting. In its current state, as a pow miner, I myself have a lot of concern about bitcoin. That\\'s not even including the leverage, which when I account for that - makes it unholdable for me. I love how bitcoin has spread, but not impressed with other aspects. That could change though and im not discounting anything at this stage.At exchanges? The resistance of centralised services to hacks is their own affair anyway -- who knows what\\'s going on under the hood at those places.\\n\\nAway from centralised exchanges, the principles of free and open source software are the best defence we have against social attacks directly on the development stream. Tried and tested too.You can also simply replace points 1-3 by \"give BTC ticker to Bitcoin core\". Occam\\'s razor.Dont forget the part where you buy mortgage backed securities on properties that have not even been built yet. Totally fine, nothing to see here. No contingen.An ASIC is a CPU. Satoshi may have intended that only certain classes of CPUs could participate, but that wasn\\'t stated anywhere as far as I know. I think we had already started GPU mining before Satoshi quit, but my memory of that part of the timeline may be incorrect.>At exchanges?\\n\\nNo, on the social internet.It\\'s a bit of a grey area for sure. We know that satoshi was concerned about asics and did not mean that they should apply to the \"one cpu one vote\" rule by his posts in bitcointalk forum.Yes, there is \\'Sybil\\' resistance (to social spoofing) on the social web: human intelligence. But not human emotion: that is too manipulable by a counter-intelligent opponent. So I would let intelligence and the intelligent rather than emotion and the emotional be my guide, personally.\\n\\nAs for what exchanges believe, which *I\\'m* still interested in, at any rate, I never imagined I could exert any real control over it. They have their own free will and as centralised entities, the choices are all theirs. If we are depending on centralised actors to do the right thing for P2P cash then it\\'s doomed because those actors are purchasable by precisely the people whose golden gooses we are trying to \\'disrupt\\'. We can\\'t depend on trying to socially capture institutions that are easily acquired by the 1%, anyway.\\n\\nThe good news is that we don\\'t have to win the whole ball game in the first innings. It is enough to keep genuine P2P cash alive as an option for consumers, even amid the inevitable multiplex of cryptocurrency choices, many of them wholly or partially coopted, that they\\'ll be faced with. From that position in the market, we can continue to educate people as to those pitfalls and we may convince some and some not, but at the very least, we will live to fight another day, of that I am certain.>Yes, there is \\'Sybil\\' resistance (to social spoofing) on the social web: human intelligence.\\n\\nThat\\'s not Sybil resistance.\\n\\nSybil resistance means that it\\'s costlier or impossible to pretend to be more than one person.\\n\\nAn example of Sybil resistance on the social internet would be requiring real names and photo identification of users.It\\'s costlier to pretend if people keep catching you out. People are exposing undisclosed \\'shills\\' all over the crypotosphere. Some of them just do it better than others. Some of them do a lousy hack job of it, generating so many false positives that they mainly contribute to smothering their own communities in fear and paranoia.Other bug that allows unlimited $btc = USDTBut they  only hired the best developers in the country .xddddExciting times... while BU was getting blasted by Core for being overly careful with our asserts (an attacker found a code path to remotely trigger one), they had a latent inflation bug!

If you\\'re actually arguing that-- please make that explicit, otherwise it won\\'t highlight the continued dishonesty of the BCH \"technical experts\" (like /u/awemany ) when they fail to correct you.\\n\\nOr is your reply just an entirely unrelated and off-topic attack?Do you see that hes not even linking to the correct developer?  BU discovered this in other clients while doing interop tests so we had no bug to fix.  Theres no PR to link to.\\n\\nThe ABC client had a history of bugs all throughout its stint, so sure, theres plenty of irrelevant commits to link to.\\n\\nAt this point with gmax i think he literally gaslights himself so communication is useless.  The fact that hes still here, 4 years later, is psychologically illuminating.Not directly, but in a World where the common man cannot afford to have their own LN channel\\n\\n\\nWorld moves to a mainly custodial LN system many *Banks* that settle between them via LN, custodian comes up with the clever idea \\n\\n\\'why do we need to have everybody\\'s coins in the LN Bank - Why not lend out a portion to Celsius\\'.....Not if you run the default LN clients currently available, no.\\n\\nBut LN nodes are autonomous and the software is not subject to a consensus algorithm. Any pair of nodes can decide to \"print Bitcoin\" by announcing liquidity that they don\\'t have, routing txns with that fake liquidity, and creating debt between them.\\n\\nConsider Alice (user) - Bob (hub) - Charlie (hub) - Dave (user)\\n\\nAlice has 1 BTC outbound liquidity to Bob, and Charlie has 1 BTC outbound liquidity to Dave. There is 1BTC in the Bob-Charlie channel, but none  in the direction Bob - Charlie (Bob\\'s balance in the channel is zero).\\n\\nAlice wants to send Dave 1 BTC, but the route will fail since Bob lacks the needed liquidity. There\\'s no other available route.\\n\\nBoth Bob and Charlie would like to earn the tasty fee they\\'d earn from routing a big 1BTC transaction, but they lack the liquidity. Fortunately, being large hubs, they belong to a federation of hubs and trust each other. So the members of the federation agree to route the transaction anyway, and settle up out of band, by using a Tab‚Ñ¢. So Charlie puts the 1 BTC on Bob\\'s Tab‚Ñ¢ and routes the transaction using customized federation Lightning nodes. Bob now owes Charlie 1 BTC that can be settled however Bob and Charlie\\'s federation agreement dictate.\\n\\nNow note that everyone in the chain is made better off. Alice and Dave get their transaction routed that would have otherwise failed. Bob and Charlie earn a nice fee from routing the giant 1BTC txn. Charlie even earns a little interest on the 1BTC that he invented out of thin air and lent to Bob.\\n\\nPrinting liquidity is *inflation.*\\n\\nNow consider poor Ernie. Ernie would like to send Dave 1BTC too, but he isn\\'t connected to a federation hub. The hubs that Ernie connects to all play by the \"rules\" and don\\'t generate debt, and so his node can\\'t find the needed 1BTC of liquidity to get to Dave. Ernie should have connected to a federation hub. Transactions through federation hubs always have the needed liquidity and never fail.\\n\\nNow consider Fred. Fred runs a hub, but he doesn\\'t belong to the federation. He objected, because federation hubs all require KYC of their channel partners, and Fred doesn\\'t like nasty old KYC. Poor Fred also doesn\\'t get to participate in routing big 1BTC transactions. He\\'s at a disadvantage to all the other hubs that joined the federation and get to route big transactions using Tabs‚Ñ¢.\\n\\nNow consider George. George would like to buy 1 BTC from Bob. But Bob has no Bitcoin to sell George at the moment. If George wanted base layer BTC, he\\'d have to pay a hefty onchain fee. But Bob could create a special Lightning wallet for George, either fully custodial or possibly even based on the federated software that he and Charlie run, which is likewise \"backed\" by the USD that George is paying with. Bob is better off because he gets to close the sale and earn the fee. George is better off because he gets his bitcoins.\\n\\nSo we see the following dynamic playing out:\\n\\n* Users are always disadvantaged if they connect to non federation hubs\\n\\n* Hub operators are always disadvantaged if they don\\'t join the federation\\n\\nNow the best part is that when I describe this scenario to Lightning developers, they shrug it off as \"impossible\" using the incredible argument that Charlie would never enter into this situation because Bob could steal the 1 BTC that Charlie put on the Tab‚Ñ¢. I suppose they make this argument because they don\\'t teach finance in CS curriculums and so these devs have never heard of \"debt.\"\\n\\nNow it\\'s definitely true that as long as Alice and Dave use regular Lightning software they can make sure that the BTC in their channels are backed by the blockchain. And it\\'s also true that in this scenario, no base layer BTC are created.\\n\\nIt\\'s also true that if Alice and Dave had opened old-school bank accounts by depositing an ounce of gold, that assuming the bank was honest, they\\'d always know that their transactions were backed by gold and that no additional gold was created. This is the way to understand Lightning, since Lightning is like old-school banking. Lightning of course takes that one step further by providing a good guarantee that the gold in Alice and Dave\\'s account can\\'t be stolen by the bank, again assuming that Alice and Dave use regular Lightning software as it exists today.\\n\\nHowever, as with old-school banking, inflation is only controlled if *everyone* follows the rule that all accounts have to be 100% backed by gold.\\n\\nIf, instead, *some* people don\\'t care if their accounts are 100% backed by gold, like Bob and Charlie, then inflation can be created, which still devalues everyone else\\'s currency on the payment layer (gold layer unaffected).\\n\\nAs the above example shows, there exists an incentive *for every party in the entire ecosystem* to relax the requirement that all accounts (channels) are 100% backed by gold (BTC).\\n\\nIf parties regularly settle out to the \"gold layer\" that can\\'t be inflated, then the systemic risk of inflation is kept in check because federation hubs (banks) must maintain strict reserve requirements else they\\'ll end up going bust.\\n\\nBut imagine that, due to the ever-increasing fees on the base layer, and the always present benefits of skipping the base layer and going directly to the second layer (see George), what develops instead is a *one way* process where Bitcoins enter the second layer and never / rarely ever settle out. This is of course exactly what happened back when dollars were backed by gold. Over time, people forgot about the gold, and just wanted the dollars, which lack inflation resistance.....\\n\\n**Moral of the story: inflation is prevented only to the degree to which actual commerce can happen strictly on the hard-money \"cash\" layer. To the degree that commerce is pushed off the hard-money \"cash\" layer onto inflatable \"payment layers,\" the same problems (inflation, federated banking networks, KYC, etc) that plagued gold-backed currencies will repeat in Bitcoin.**\\n\\ncc: /u/don2468Who is watching to prevent that? Two or more parties can run custom software to do fractional reserve, even create new currency out of thin air.\\n\\nThe only thing that guarantees the 21M limit is the blockchain. All the custom software needs to ensure is that the BTCs will be there when the individual closes the channel (if they can, that is. Fees can keep most people from being able to have their own channel).This is completely confused for me, my exposure to encryption is too shortYou don\\'t understand how custodial solutions on LN works. They are like exchanges. They can credit more than they have locked up. \\n\\nEg: Suppose Strike has 500 BTC locked up in LN. Strike however can credit their users  much more than 500 BTC this is because any transactions between Strike users don\\'t need to go through the wider LN network. Only when users need to send to someone not on Strike will you start to use up their 500 BTC reserves. Custodial solutions on LN are recreating the FIAT system.\\n\\nThis obvious with  ElSalvador Chivo slip up when they brag about 3 million  Chivo users. 3\\\\*30 = 90 Million USD. Which at the time of the brag they didn\\'t have enough Bitcoin equivalent.I don\\'t recall anyone talking about putting such a check in (I don\\'t read everything everyone says though) but just knowing the development process I can already see the objections.  The objections you would probably have to overcome are:\\n\\n* It is an unnecessary burden to scan the entire UTXO each block slowing validation.\\n* It is always better to fix a problem at its source (i.e. the actual bug) then add in \"catch all\" guards that may actually hide the problems from us (i.e. technical debt).\\n\\nThere may be more, but they instantly spring to mind.  There are of course positives like you say, but in bitcoin development everything is a debate and takes time.***\\nu/bitmegalomaniac, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2je3n9jezkdmg7x3sw6um94rg475juwxqsuq) `0.00012528 BCH` | `~0.08 USD` by u/don2468\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).

A third party providing LN services doesn\\'t have to forward all the LN guarantees to their clients.\\n\\nIt\\'s similar to how an exchange can do all kinds of shady shit in the background using Bitcoin directly. Even if Bitcoin *itself* guarantees a coin cap, the exchanges can ignore that fact to a certain extent (until they collapse like Mt. Gox, at least).\\n\\nBut no matter what the exchanges do, they *can\\'t* actually make more Bitcoin.Sorry for the slow reply\\n\\n\\nThanks for the heads up, it was an interesting read, the false reporting of liquidity in order to capture fees was a new twist for me. I know the basics of Lightning but really should look into the nuts and bolts, I follow that Bob & Charlies channel doesn\\'t have to have the liquidity (in the needed direction) they can report what they like but can Bob & Charlie just report that they have a channel even when they don\\'t, if not can they hire the short term use of one from their friend JamieD though it will never be used for a LN payment just as a prop to point to. \\n\\n\\nI probably need to wait for Mastering Lightning Network. though I am only so far through Mastering Bitcoin, oh well\\n\\n\\nyou have probably seen them but after a bit of googling I came across\\n\\n\\n* [Liquidity abstraction in Lightning Network](https://medium.com/coinmonks/liquidity-abstraction-in-lightning-network-3d7a1d76ac82)\\n\\n\\nwhich points to [hosted channels](https://github.com/btcontract/hosted-channels-rfc) \\n\\n\\nnot dived in enough yet to see how relevant to the points you made are but \\n\\n\\n>>  hosted channels can be created on the fly with zero on-chain fund allocation on either Host or Client side\\n\\n\\nraises red flags\\n\\n\\nu/chaintipAll LN transactions *must* be valid Bitcoin transactions, and are easily verifiable as such. Any attempt to mint more coin in a LN channel would fail, as the transaction itself wouldn\\'t be seen as valid.\\n\\nEven if a channel colluded and somehow managed to fake how much coin they have, there\\'s still no possible way for channels to mint more coin, because the amount of coin in a channel is fixed. The only thing channels can do is change how that amount is divided.\\n\\nSo if a channel somehow managed to pretend it had infinite liquidity both ways, it couldn\\'t change how much Bitcoin it actually had, nor could it change how much Bitcoin anyone else had.\\n\\nEven if everyone on the LN decided to mint and accept fake Bitcoin, that *still* wouldn\\'t result in more Bitcoin, because none of those transactions would be valid, and none would ever get processed on-chain. \\n\\nTL;DR: even if LN somehow went entirely full retard - a completely unrealistic scenario - it *still* couldn\\'t produce more Bitcoin.Well it\\'s pretty clear you have no idea how LN works, or you wouldn\\'t be asking such questions. To wit:\\n\\n1. LN channels are created by locking up Bitcoin on chain, pegging the balance of that LN channel to that amount of locked Bitcoin.\\n2. All LN transactions are valid Bitcoin transactions - just not ones that are broadcast to the blockchain. An LN transaction that does something illegal - spending more Bitcoin than the channel has, for example - would be rejected by the counterparty as malformed.\\n3. If, somehow, the LN channel managed to create and sign such a malformed transaction and tried to spend it, said transaction would be rejected by the validating nodes and kicked from the mempool. It would never be mined into a block.\\n4. If, somehow, the *entire* LN network went bananas and started trying to print Bitcoin like crazy, none of the transactions would ever go through. No Bitcoin would or could be created no matter how screwy things got.The ability for a third party to fake how much Bitcoin they have is a concern, but it in no way means that they are somehow minting more Bitcoin. \\n\\nMore to the point, it\\'s not a problem with LN itself. Any situation where a custodial third party exists can potentially have this problem.> It is an unnecessary burden to scan the **entire UTXO** each block slowing validation.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is the case, keep a running total, then the only update is scanning UTXO\\'s that the block touches (something that is done anyway) adding/subtracting as you go, dealing with fees might complicate things but one would not need to scan entire UTXO\\n\\n\\n> It is always better to fix a problem at its source (i.e. the actual bug) \\n\\n\\nYou can\\'t know what the bug might be ahead of time and it might be  too late by then\\n\\n\\nI am no dev but sanity checks (iff they don\\'t have too great an overhead) on such an important feature seem like a useful feature. \\n\\n\\n> then add in \"catch all\" guards that may actually hide the problems from us (i.e. technical debt).\\n\\n\\n\\nYep agreed having this feature in every client is most likely overkill, and as you say adding *non vital* code in critical parts is not a good idea.\\n\\n\\n> There are of course positives like you say, but in bitcoin development everything is a debate and takes time.\\n\\n\\neverything is a trade off, thanks for your thoughts u/chaintip\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**edit:** in fact i think a \\'total coin count\\' would fit very nicely with code for UTXO commitments (from the little I understand), plus  adding total coins as a consensus rule. and exposing the total so that it can be checked with an SPV wallet with all the assurances covered by PoW (you know there is no inflation or all the miners and all the exchanges plus large retailers etc are out to get you)\\n\\n\\n[original unedited post](https://archive.md/2KgUP)Dont forget Greg Maxwell has a known history of lying and manipulation starting from his wikipedia days, which is written in stone.

How many channels saturates the network?You can. It\\'s called \"closing the channel\". Pretty basic stuff.But, again, all of this happens *independently from* and *outside of* LN, just as it would happen *independently from* and *outside of* the base layer.\\n\\nYou can argue all day and night about how third parties ruin things and cause virtual Bitcoin inflation and whatnot, but that line of argument will never allow LN to create more Bitcoin.\\n\\nLN itself can\\'t do that.

Do not collect $200. \\n\\nGiven that this reply chain was started on the claim that it can (and my negation thereof), I don\\'t really see any value in throwing third-parties into the mix. It\\'s simply not relevant.No. LN coins are similar to 0-conf transactions, but with more security.All in all, the first variations of the Lightning Network can make up to\\xa025 million transactions in a single second and settle it on the Bitcoin blockchain as one transaction. \\n\\nCurrently, the number of nodes with channels is\\xa0round about 14,000, or about 58% of all nodes. The remaining 42% are simply there, for the time being, at least. But for those who do choose to open and fund a Lightning Network channel, there is the potential to earn yield and that\\'s what it takes to start up, you see the yield and dump in money which is literally at stake.  Running a lightning node typically\\xa0doesn\\'t pay more than a few pennies per month at most. Making money is not an incentive for running a Lightning node, however, as it typically doesn\\'t pay more than a few pennies per month at most. The hardware required to run a node will cost more on average then current profits, so buckle up to be invested in for future ‚úåOpening and closing channels are prohibitively expensive on the BTC shitcoin.\\n\\nthe endgame of LN is degrading BTC to be fully custodial.\\n\\nYou\\'re either a pathetic shill or an idiot.No, closing a channel does not make use of the Lightning Network.\\n\\nClosing a channel means *exiting* the Lightning Network.> I don\\'t really see any value in throwing third-parties into the mix. It\\'s simply not relevant[.](https://archive.md/W34JK)\\n\\n\\n1. What problem does Bitcoin try to fix in the World?\\n\\n\\n2. What problem Does LN try to fix in Bitcoin? \\n\\n\\nif it cannot fix Bitcoins shortcomings then the actual outcome is the same - Fed2.0, though the 1% will have greater control of their and your money under the Bitcoin Standard.\\n\\n\\nThanks for the discussion.Uh, what? There is no payment failures, liquidity issues, risks of theft or trusted parties needed to accept a 0-conf payment.Tell me you retard without telling me you a retard. Smoke more hopium bro.All of that is both incorrect and irrelevant. Perhaps you\\'d like to try again?\"If that was true, you would be able to send LN \\\\[bitcoins\\\\] to a bitcoin address.\"\\n\\nI\\'m not reading anything in that statement that would require the use of LN to send the coins.Channel splicing is also possible where you close the channel (or multiple channels), send the on-chain payment, and open a new channel with the change output, all within the same transaction (atomic operation).\\n\\nWith Taproot I expect this to become fairly widespread, because, if I understand correctly, with Taproot these channel splicing operations become identical and indistinguishable to regular on-chain transactions that regular traditional wallets would generate. In other words, it literally costs nothing to do this (no extra fees etc.), compared to what a traditional wallet would create on-chain when it sends a transaction.\\n\\nWith Taproot, funding the lightning channel is also indistinguishable thanks to key aggregation, so you also get that for free. So when someone sends you an on-chain transaction, it can instantly become a lightning channel for free. So with these, you get the best of both worlds. You can get lightning channels funded as easily as somebody just sending you on-chain transactions, with no extra fees for the sender or receiver (compared to everybody just using traditional on-chain wallets). The sender doesn\\'t even know that they\\'re funding your lightning channel, because to them they\\'re just sending to an aggregated single pubkey and for all they know this is just a singlesig wallet. And then with these free channels you can still make on-chain payments identically to what a regular on-chain singlesig wallet can create, because we use splicing and hide the uncooperative lightning script conditions in the Taproot MAST and aggregate the signatures.\\n\\nSo you can end up with something that is equivalent to a regular wallet, but one in which all of your UTXOs are also free lightning channels, moving potentially thousands or millions of subsequent microtransactions off chain instead of them all needing to go on chain. And if you still want to send on-chain, you just spend these UTXOs like normal (the UTXO selection process just becomes the channel selection process), but then the change output also becomes a new lightning channel for free (i.e. the change output instantly funds a new lightning channel for you).\\n\\nThe only fair difference between this structure and the traditional singlesig on-chain wallet is that it\\'s a multisig wallet and it requires interaction and cooperation to generate these on-chain transactions. You need that for lightning anyway, but with channel splicing you\\'d also need it for on-chain, whereas the traditional singlesig wallet can create these transactions by themselves. That\\'s fair, but it can also be a benefit because of security, etc. You could set spending limits and ask for two-factor authentication to authorize payments, etc. So there\\'s a reason you might want this kind of multisig setup even absent lightning (for example, the Blockstream Green wallet already works in a similar way because of the security benefits, and that is not a lightning wallet).\\n\\nCaveat: I might be wrong about some things because I don\\'t know enough about the technical details of all of this.LN locks down the channel closing transaction in such a way that the usual 0-conf shenanigans (RBF and double spends, for example) don\\'t work.\\n\\nPayment failures, liquidity issues, and trusted third parties don\\'t apply to the LN closing transactions (also they\\'re not really security issues). Trusted third parties especially, as LN doesn\\'t require trust in general.\\n\\nRisks of theft are a threat inherent to using LN; there\\'s no way around it. That said, the risk is functionally zero unless one is doing something stupid. Regardless, the risks *are* something to be aware of before using LN, for sure.Channel splicing is still exiting the LN.Meh. If you want to be super pedantic about it you should say that it\\'s _entering_ the LN too. You can\\'t describe the splicing operation as \\'exiting\\' without also describing it as \\'entering\\' at the exact same time. Anyway, who cares? My point is made.My point is made as well.\\n\\nClosing a channel in order to move funds onchain is not \"sending the money through LN to a Bitcoin address.\" It\\'s literally \"taking the funds out of the LN so you can make an onchain transaction.\"Yeah but your point seems to be a boring tautology that nobody disagrees with. There is literally no other way to do it, so of course. We all get it... yes... when you receive funds on the chain you didn\\'t receive them via lightning. Whoop-de-doo. Everybody understands that sending on-chain cannot be done off-chain by definition. It doesn\\'t need to be said.\\n\\n>Closing a channel means exiting the Lightning Network.  \\n>Channel splicing is still exiting the LN.\\n\\nI think you\\'re judging the truth of this statement from the point of view of the funds being sent, whereas I\\'m judging it from the point of view of the user. Sure, from the perspective of the funds that the user is sending to the third-party, the funds are \"exiting the LN\". Not sure what that matters though. It still doesn\\'t mean that LN funds aren\\'t \\'fully backed\\' or 1:1 with BTC or whatever is being alleged in the context of this talking point.\\n\\nMy point was just that with splicing, the _user_ is not exiting the LN. Without splicing, it would be fair to say that the user _would_ be exiting the LN and then potentially re-entering it later (because it\\'s non-atomic), but with splicing I think it\\'s fair to say that the user never exited the LN and yet they still had the flexibility of using these LN funds on-chain. Sometimes LN funds are described as being \"locked up\" in channels, but with splicing this isn\\'t really a fair characterization. So my point was not a tautological one but an informative one about the abilities of splicing, and of Taproot making splicing essentially free to use.This is a very informed reply.\\n\\n>Sometimes LN funds are described as being \"locked up\" in channels, but with splicing this isn\\'t really a fair characterization.\\n\\nThe main reason that funds are described as \"locked up\" is that they require a timelocked onchain transaction to \"get them out.\" If your counterparty is malicious or unresponsive, you have to wait to move them. Timeouts vary but depending on the service are typically days or weeks. \\n\\nSplicing is a nice enhancement, but it really just reduces the cost of the closing / reopening event by half. It doesn\\'t change the nature of the funds being locked in the first place.Yes, that\\'s fair enough. Agreed üëçGot to meet the co-owner and a few of the employees. Super cool place.

Thanks for sharing!\\nu/chaintipLooking at this helps me remember my old day when I use chits and  I have a lot of cash in GTA cityLove too. First the store is separate into to sections. The front of the store is the retail part.  They specialize in 3-D manufacturing, cryptocurrency education, and selling crypto related T-shirts and knickknacks. I bought a really cool T-shirt of theirs today.\\n\\nWhen paying they utilized the merchant side of Exodus wallet. Not sure how that works, but I would assume most crypto‚Äòs that are supported by exodus would work. \\n\\nI will be joining them on Tuesday morning for a crypto and coffee. Sounds like it‚Äôs similar to the old bitcoin meetups I used to go to. They are sore focus heavily on teaching the basics of cold storage and blocks to curious people who want to learn. They charge for their class. I‚Äôm not sure how much exactly but they said they are doing well. \\n\\nThey told me they had 250 people at the grand opening. They started off as a manufacture of facemasks and moved into the crypto space. \\n\\nThey also have a St. Louis-based bitcoin ATM set up.

Thanks for bringing it to our attentionIt sounds like a great idea. It adds another (strong) layer of security to the network and doesn\\'t break the foundation of Nakamoto Consensus.\\n\\nI would however, like to see serious scrutiny over the proposal.Yes! Finally the BMP is paid the attention it deserves. I never could fathom why the BMP posts didn\\'t get traction. The BMP could have avoided the split fiasco with the segwit2x/NYAG BS. Miner\\'s would have seen hashpower vote in real time and moved forward with increasing blocksize. P2P electronic cash wouldn\\'t have become a minority fork / a non-P2P handicapped & controlled chain wouldn\\'t have kept the BTC ticker.What happens to orphaned votes?[VanityTXID](https://github.com/TinosNitso/VanityTXID-Plugin) only works right now because miners allow it. Eventually they might crack down on it, which would require changing the exact addresses (script-code) involved. It\\'ll probably be **ignored**, unless it gets popular. :SLooks greatIt\\'s a great idea for the betterment.it will increase the security.What happened to BU\\'s new coin?I think it would be great if more people subjected Javier\\'s protocol to scrutiny so we can clearly identify those drawbacks.Yeah my reaction was the same after reading all of it, sounds like an advertisement.It changes every time a new vote is cast. Thanks. This is a communication mechanism, not a vote.  Of course any sybil-resistant commmunication could be used as a vote, but that is beyond the scope.\\n\\nIn a situation where mining is banned in a major market, a mostly-anonymous channel where miners can communicate makes sense.>Bch makes up like 2% of sha256, the other 98% could easily manipulate these votes.\\n\\nBMP calculates hashpower with a very large block window of 4032 blocks.\\n\\nBCH chooses the next block with 1% of the total hashpower and proves to work correctly, no reorgs or double spending attacks.\\n\\nLiterally a few months ago miners have voted /BCHN/ and I didn\\'t hear a single complaint about the security of that vote to make an important decision.\\n\\nSmartBCH chooses validators mainly by voting with hashpower and only 38% of the hashpower participates.

Please suggest some sites where I could read about these kind of information, thank you.Thank you for your support.\\n\\nBMP is getting traction exponentially. Remember that Jiang Zhuoer proposed the BMP in IFPv2. Unfortunately just at that time the covid hit hard in China and only 14 days later Amaury took the opportunity to stop BMP initiative with his disastrous IFPv3 which includes a triked hashpower vote.\\n\\nAlso Jihan told me that he wanted to fund the BMP, but at that time internal changes happened in Bitmain. A lot of bad luck.\\n\\nAlso, Bitcoin Core devs always badmouthed this idea. CSW and Amaury insulted me many times. They always say shit about the BMP because they want central control (thats why splits happens).\\n\\nIn short: **Devs with central power don\\'t want miners with decentralized power.**\\n\\nBut the BMP is unstoppable. It contains inside the Satoshi\\'s original solution.\\n\\nWhen we achieve our goals I will publish the complete long story.You mean orphan blocks?\\n\\nOrphan blocks are not part of The Nakamoto Consensus. It is errant/wasted hashpower. The BMP only computes the hashpower of the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.The same as with divergant consensuses. BMP is within a consensus: blockchain, orphans are not in the chain. Leveraging OP_RETURN in BCH, but some form of BMP (juggling hashes) is possible on any chainYeah it\\'s great, hope it\\'ll play a major role in upcoming days, market\\'s very unpredictable these days.Yeah even I am confused about that, what the hell happened to that coin??Yeah true It\\'ll be great, people should show their presence to this protocol...The BMP is [these](https://github.com/JavierGonzalez/BMP) 2,000 lines of code and [on-chain](https://bmp.virtualpol.com/info/action/91162d0670c72fca6622d117e4d6b4149a3855de780295e852e471504b937c14) facts.\\n\\nBut we want to learn how to communicate it properly. What we are trying to do now is to increase participation to attract the attention of BCH miners and start the most important decentralized organization in the world. Any idea or criticism is welcome.> This is a communication mechanism, not a vote.\\n\\nThen why is it called a \\'parliament\\'?Shadowbanned by reddit.com, manually re-approved.So modelling of your voting proposal shows that the DAA eliminates opportunity for voting manipulation, given the window of 4032 blocks?> SmartBCH chooses validators mainly by voting with hashpower and only 38% of the hashpower participates. And millions in production depend on this system. And no one has complained, because it\\'s not a problem.\\n\\n> PoW is a free-market capitalist competition (possibly the toughest there is) based on \"business creativity\". It includes time-to-market, risk management, investment, trading, human resources, geopolitical risks, engineering, logistics and many other factors besides money.\\n\\nEven when you factor all that in, if you have 50,000$, you can buy 10 ASICs, and if I have 5000, I can\\'t magically turn that into 50,000$ and buy 10 ASICs I can only buy 1.\\n\\n> Hashpower voting is universally verifiable, uncensorable and decentralized.\\n\\nNot decentralized when the vast majority of the user base can\\'t afford to be included, and you only leave it up to those who are wealthy. Votes from people with more money are almost always going to be worth more than those who don\\'t enough.\\n\\n\\n> SmartBCH chooses validators mainly by voting with hashpower and only 38% of the hashpower participates. And millions in production depend on this system. And no one has complained, because it\\'s not a problem.\\n\\nThis is because mining/validating only needs to be decentralized enough to prevent censorship and 51 attacks.\\n\\nPolling miners for support of an upgrade is important, but miner voting shouldn\\'t be the be all end all of making protocol decisions.\\n\\n> The CHIP process is not decentralized (a legitimate voting system is necessary).\\n\\nIs it not? bitcoincashresearch.org is just where a lot of people share their CHIPs, its not the \"official\" aggregator for them. CHIPs can be shared in censorship resistant channels such as matrix, irc, etc. It just has to be able to reach the general community.Remember how Binance pool voted for BCHN with 50% of BCH hash and then completely disappear once the split happened?> > The BMP empowers the **miners of the last 28 days of BCH blocks** to make themselves heard\\n> \\n> Therefore your claim is absolutely false.\\n\\nDirect some extra hash power to bch for a month, it would require a very little amount of hash rate be redirected from btc mining pools.\\n\\n> Is block production based off of wealth? No. It is based on proof of work. The BMP is exactly the same.\\n\\nThere are other factors, but mostly yes. Ultimately, 50,000$ will buy you 10 S19s, 5000$ will get you 1. You can\\'t avoid this.\\n\\n> It\\'s great so why not get the miners involved, too?\\n\\nPolling miners is obviously important, but it shouldn\\'t be the be all end all of protocol decisions.\\n\\n> Vitalik also hasn\\'t harnessed the power of on-chain governance via miners, which means we can be the first.\\n\\nI didn\\'t say he, did, he said that governance through having a decent percentage of users running nodes, and possibly also fraud proof systems for light clients is a good system, I say its better than relying solely on hash power.\\n\\nAlso, being the first to do something isnt a good reason to do something. You should do something because it would be beneficial, not cause you\\'d be the first.\\n\\nAlso, Ethereum does use miner voting for block size cap (though they might phase that out).\\n\\n> The BCH blockchain itself looks good to me.\\n\\nDo you know what I meant by fraud proof? Rather than just relying on the longest chain, if there is a split, a full node who uses the same protocol version as I want to follow could deliver a fraud proof on this chain that uses a protocol version I don\\'t want, so I would know not to follow that chain without downloading and verifying the entire block.\\n\\nOf course, this likely won\\'t happen on bch, as it requires stateless validation, meaning there would need to be a merkle root of the utxo set in block headers.\\n\\nWhen done in tandem with data availability sampling this provides pretty much the same security as a full node to a light client, assuming there is one honest full node, so a 1 of N trust model.\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nI wanna add that I don\\'t think every person and their dog needs to run a full node, like btc supporters do. However, it is beneficial to have a decent amount of users running nodes, until there is a herd immunity, as vitalik talks about in his article I linkedIs the consensus still 51%?In this forum, use the search bar to search about it in r/btc. Hong kong agreement, nee york agreement, segwit2x...That\\'s fine as long as the lag doesn\\'t disqualify the vote meeting a deadline.Damn can you suggest some sites about this information? I really wanna study more about it!Correct, but has nothing to do with my question.From French \"parler\" which means \"a place to talk\".I dont know, ask its creator.  But sure we can all imagine that this could be used for the mining portion of a governing body.  But that does not mean that it WILL in BCH.  Irrespective of speculation, what it IS is a way for miners to communicate messages signed by hash power.Thank you. But... reddit is censoring comments? why in this case?Can you tell me some real facts about shadowbanning of reddit subs??Damn do reddit even censor things? I really know nothing about this bro!There is no \"manipulation\" with a window of 4032 blocks. Since it requires stable mining for almost a month.\\n\\nIt is actually being called \"manipulation\" for a hashpower force to come from BTC to BCH mining legitimately to somehow influence some hypothetical major vote in the future.\\n\\nThis can\\'t really be called \"manipulation\" or attack. It is literally how Bitcoin was designed.I\\'m sorry but I have to be honest with you.\\n\\nBitcoin is not democratic. Bitcoin is hashcracy. It is a consensus mechanism based on hashpower voting. PoW is a free market capitalist competition.\\n\\nIt\\'s all the best we\\'ve got.\\n\\nThere is no hash function to solve the sybil problem for humans, to avoid \"double voting\". No one has solved this. Therefore, the democratic potential of Bitcoin is zero.\\n\\nBut PoW has been shown that power continually changes hands from the least efficient miners to the most efficient miners. It is fair because everyone competes on an equal footing. And it is not the same corrupt people. Innovation is allowed. And the miners are subjugated to the market price (users are the absolute power, but not executive).\\n\\nHowever I think Bitcoin is legitimate, as it links miners to the welfare of the private service they offer us (in exchange for a fee).\\n\\nBitcoin is the private business of the miners, literally. This is the simple truth. And it always has been. Satoshi Nakamto is the first miner.\\n\\n>Is it not? bitcoincashresearch.org is just where a lot of people share their CHIPs, its not the \"official\" aggregator for them. CHIPs can be shared in censorship resistant channels such as matrix, irc, etc. It just has to be able to reach the general community.\\n\\nNo, this form of organization is not decentralized. That domain is controlled by one owner. Those forums and spaces (like this reddit) have an owner. Spaces like slack, telegram... are all centralized spaces.\\n\\nFaced with the inaction of the miners, the devs tend to form a centralized cartel where they pretend that \"nobody rules\" or even worse \"everybody rules\", but the simple truth is that only a few make the decisive decisions.\\n\\nFor example destroying the adoption with the 1MB limit was a decision made by a few devs of the Blockstream Core cartel, maybe 5. The BSV split was decided by two people (CSW and Calvin). The XEC split was decided by one person (Amaury). And so on and so forth.\\n\\nWe intend to build the rails of the new world economy. There are key decisions to be made about the direction of the blockchain. Concrete and specific decisions. And if not by voting with hashpower, then in a centralized way.\\n\\nBitcoin development has NEVER been truly decentralized and my goal is to make it decentralized for the first time in Bitcoin Cash, according to the original design.To be fair, we should point out that some BCH miners burned several million dollars that week to defend BCH [by hashwar](https://twitter.com/JavierGonzalez/status/1427394456202973185).\\n\\nThey burned millions mining at a loss. I don\\'t forget [that](https://twitter.com/JavierGonzalez/status/1427394476893515777/photo/1).If I mine BCH blocks I am by definition a BCH miner. It seems you are arguing against PoW. That\\'s a bit off-topic.Within the BMP, complex decisions can be agreed upon by 66% for example. It is a consensus that can and should be built as we go along.\\n\\nBMP include this option in \"[type of voting](https://bmp.virtualpol.com/voting/create)\". It is extensible and the parameters can be expanded as needed.We are conversing in modern English, not etymological French. Here is the entire set of definitions for the word \\'parliament\\' in English:\\n\\n> 1. the national legislature of Great Britain, consisting of the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  \\n> 2. the national legislature of certain former British colonies and possessions.  \\n> 3. the national legislature in various other countries.  \\n> 4. any of several high courts of justice in France before 1789.  \\n> 5. an assembly on public or national affairs  \\n\\nPortraying the BMP as merely a method of communication reminds me of when it used to be portrayed as merely a method of \\'preconsensus\\'.Will this implement the full BMP or will there be more pieces that need further approval afterward? The PDF by u/Ozn0g is a bit sketchy on that.> Thank you.

I\\'m a little curious how 4032 (28 days approx) of mining BCH might be gamed by non-vested interests. The equivalent is common practice in other areas of commerce where \\'[dumping](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dumping.asp)\\' occurs, with a business absorbing losses in the short-term, to suppress the competition over the longer-term.  Has your modelling for a 4032 block window shown it to be immune from malicious intent of voting? I\\'m assuming that your modeling demonstrates the DAA absorbs the effect of intentional contamination of voting outcomes.That\\'s a different split, but yeah.I\\'m not the biggest fan of PoW, but I don\\'t hate it either. I don\\'t like asic mining, but that\\'s besides the point.\\n\\nMining only needs to be decentralized enough to prevent censorship and 51 attacks. However the \"minimum required\" decentralization for governance is a lot higher than the minimum for censorship and 51 attack prevention. \\n\\n\\\\> If I mine BCH blocks I am by definition a BCH miner. \\n\\nI didn\\'t say otherwise. I\\'m arguing against PoW being used for governance, not for consensus. I did go on a bit of a tangent about fraud proofs, but that\\'s because fraud proofs allow light clients to ensure they are following a chain that follows the same protocol version they desire without having to download and verify the entire chain, which is very related to governance.Thanks for the explanation!\\n\\nu/chaintipLatin is the common origin (parabol≈ç).\\n\\nIn any case, the majority of BCH hashpower can make a vote to change the name and I will implement the result.unsure if you are trying to troll /u/Ozn0ga or simply got a bad result when searching for a definition but his french root definition holds true in the full english word. \\n\\nDefinition here: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parliament\\n1. a formal conference for the discussion of public affairs \\n\\nalso here: https://www.dictionary.com/browse/parliament\\n5. a meeting or assembly for conference on public or national affairs.\\n\\nI could make this list longer if neededWe are not implementing the BMP.  Its already implemented.  This BUIP just lets us participate by making a few small changes and doing a small amount of mining so we have the ability to post messages.Ok, thanks.Mining is a complex system. Dynamic, stochastic. I don\\'t think it is possible to do demonstrations like the ones you request.\\n\\nSimply put, a sufficiently large hashpower strength will always be able to have an influence on the BMP proportional to its hashpower percentage in Bitcoin Cash.\\n\\nBMP calculates this stably and accurately.\\n\\nAs I said in this thread, another recommended strategy is to agree to deals with more than 51%. For example 66%. This would make the system even more secure.\\n\\nIn any case, the next Bitcoin Cash block is decided by hashpower voting. The majority of hashpower can always double-spend and destroy the reputation of BCH. This has never happened and there are [on-chain precedents](https://twitter.com/JavierGonzalez/status/1427394456202973185) of executive hashpower willing to protect BCH in case of an attack.You are right, you talk about BCH-XEC split, and this is a strange case.\\n\\nBinance pool stopped making blocks between:  \\n2020-11-15 14:13:29  \\n2020-11-23 14:13:19\\n\\nThere was no problem because other miners quickly backed mining BCH instead.\\n\\nI hope that with the BMP we will be able in the future to know the whys and wherefores.What other form of governance is there that depends upon merit, demonstrated proof of work?> I\\'m not the biggest fan of PoW\\n\\nI think a lot of people missing that PoS is the recreation of pre-Satoshi finance. People-dependance, arbitrary rules, return to low cost of changing consensus to your likes, inability to objectively weight one ledger against another when determining truth and debating history\\n\\nSpending energy to construct ledgers makes it digital pyramids of Giza (mining industry as cranes for building new and new pyramids are pretty big right now, but they will grow much smaller over time).

It is obviously *not* called a \\'parliament\\' to evoke obscure alternate meanings from an ancient language that nobody uses.Your reply about my \\'bad result\\' is strange because the definitions you are offering are almost word-for-word the same as one that I gave.OK thanks. Sounds like there will be no more BMP-compatibility upgrades necessary then for full participation.Thanks for this important information brother, really appreciate it!!Thanks for engaging in dialogue. I realize social media is an exhausting medium of conversation.I didn\\'t say anything about PoSI will build a decentralized forum as well. And maybe a kanban controlled with hashpower. BMP is a versatile platform.Now I am at home with more time and I want to give you a more direct answer.\\n\\nMy intentions are clear. I intend that The Nakamoto Consensus (miners as well as devs and other BCH actors with delegated HP) meet to talk and decide in a decentralized way using the BMP protocol. And this is clearly in the voting PDF, in my comments in this thread and in literally hundreds of posts I have written over the last 4 years (I have always said the same thing).\\n\\nBut at the same time, this is just my opinion. And my opinion is irrelevant as I don\\'t control hashpower.\\n\\nAnd I can\\'t see the future on how exactly the organization want to conform if starts using BMP. Probably things unimaginable today will happen.\\n\\nFor now, BU is going to run a BMP node and we will have a on-chain conversation testing the protocol. Maybe an irrelevant test vote. And we will try to involve as many participants as possible. Miners, devs, communication, moderators, etc. From BU and every active dev team.\\n\\nMaybe it will be used to make important decisions.

This removes Proof of Stake\\'s largest issue, long range attacks. This is because the thing you are proving you have is not dependent on the current state of the chain, but proof of something physical at the time of making the proof.I\\'ll read something on it when it gains at least some momentum against PoW\\n\\nConceptually I still like PoW more, cos u can\\'t vote for both competing forks with the same hash.

In other words, a sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future. Even though economists argue that sunk costs are no longer relevant to future rational decision-making, in everyday life, people often take previous expenditures in situations, such as repairing a car or house, into their future decisions regarding those properties.\\n \\n^([ )[^(F.A.Q)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiSummarizer/wiki/index#wiki_f.a.q)^( | )[^(Opt Out)](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiSummarizerBot&message=OptOut&subject=OptOut)^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)](https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/about/banned)^( | )[^(GitHub)](https://github.com/Sujal-7/WikiSummarizerBot)^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5)It\\'s more than that.

It happens that BCH is the nost widely adopted crypto according to it.\\n\\nIf you believe the site is disproportionally used by BCH users, that\\'s fine. You can create/convince others to create a similar site for BTC users so we can compare.\\n\\nAs far as our available metrics show, BCH is the most adopted crypto. If the metrics are incomplete, then there must be some effort to add more data to it.So far in today\\'s world BCH is the mostly adopted crypto. Keeping aside BTC.Demand for \"the most adopted crypto\" is behind many other currencies. Why do you think \"the most adopted crypto\" has less demand than several other cryptocurrencies?People be tend out always going out with the flow. BCH is on a run so are they.People are euphoric and don\\'t know what they are doing. The overall market is in a massive bubble. Not just crypto.> People are euphoric and don\\'t know what they are doing.\\n\\nBut you\\'re the exception?we should always live upto our expectation the more u expect the lesser you get.Yes.\\n\\nJust like me and the rest of the Bitcoin community was in 2013.\\n\\nWas the ahead of the game exception then, still am now.  Still advocating peer to peer electronic cash.You guys are bound and determined to die on this hill, aren‚Äôt you? Die financially. :(Some things are worth dying for.As someone who is quite into Bitcoin and probably can be considered a maximalist - fuck Tether.No one has bags of Tether unless they\\'re trading shit coins. The highest volume trade pairs of BCH are all stable coins with Tether at the topHonestly, where are you seeing these Tether apologists?\\n\\nI mean like any stable, it has a use case, it\\'s probably slightly more risky than some others, but at the same time it\\'s been round so long, and people have been saying it\\'ll fail since the start, and yet it hasn\\'t.They have either really heavy bags or are paid.R/btc attacking btcI am not a btc maxi, but you know i am in the btc camp when it comes to bch.\\n\\nBury Tether... that‚Äôs what I say.\\n\\nGuess not being a maxi lets you see the truth as it really is. Being a maxi is bad for your brain. I love Max Kesier... but it drives me nuts he is a one coiner. Hell, I even like Peter Schiff.. and he is a no coiner.Its looking more like bch fanboys looking into charts.It\\'s funny to watch people who throw mud at Tether. But they are not going to sell itWait....this was the guy that was RIGHT about brittany being treated like shit all along.  HahahahaAnd in which stablecoin do you propose to sell the crypto - USDC, or what?If USD is the problem and its inflationary. That in turn makes Tether just as worthless... which then pumps bitcoin. Until bitcoin has pairings by assets with sustained values like gold, silver, oil, and so on... Well the honest truth is its a Bubble.#DBA TOKEN is a token to bag now ....it has high potential get it on pancake swap..soon it will be listed on CEX at dafriexchane. .and many more CEX\\'S in due timeInvest today with DBAPeople who have one Bitcoin in their wallet do not understand anything about crypto. I see the point of keeping several currencies in my wallet. Including TetherThen the sooner tether and bitfinex are removed from the crypto ecosystem, the better for everyone.And your point is‚Ä¶ ?> Honestly, where are you seeing these Tether apologists?\\n\\nHe isn\\'t. This is what he does with his time.>Honestly, where are you seeing these Tether apologists?\\n\\nIn his imagination**They respond to my Tether posts. Not immediately, but when the post has cooled down, coming up with but but Tether is a good boy, leave them alone üò≠**\\n\\nMany are already here in this post.Not unlike you, Egon. Right?No, read the FAQ/history of this sub.So you\\'re OK with altcoins but not BCH, meanwhile supporting BTC. Hard to think of a more likely-to-succeed plan for self defeat...\\n\\n*\\'Sir! Excuse me, sir! Yes, give me that hijacked-by-the-rich bitcoin, plus every alternative under the sun except the one that still makes a bitcoin do exactly what a bitcoin was originally meant to do. That\\'s the one I DON\\'T want.\\'*\\n\\nBasically you have a blind spot for Satoshi\\'s way alone -- anyone\\'s ideas for how crypto should be used by the masses are OK to you *except* Satoshi Nakamoto\\'s. This is a ridiculous stance, purely ridiculous. I mean think about it. How do you explain Nakamoto\\'s plan for how to scale crypto to the masses having been carved specifically out of your mind, leaving only the ideas of others who failed to do what he did (despite trying for most of their professional lives), and then played catch-up? How did a bunch of come-latelies manage to eclipse Satoshi\\'s groundbreaking ideas in your mind with their own ten-year-older, previously stalled plans?malware warning!USDC? Damn, I wouldn\\'t use it. It\\'s backer was taken to the court recently. And there were a lot of rumors that most of USDC circling (pun intended) in obline casinos and illegal offshores.I have trouble understanding that. If it is bot trading, just switch to a stablecoin with sufficient volume. Old habits die hard.It came first I guess, idk never really used stable coins. I guess they\\'re good for trading but I\\'m not a traderMost trading platforms don\\'t have USDC swaps only teatherIf you have $ on an exchange, it could actually be Tether.\\n\\nEdit: Depends on exchangebasically cause it from coinbase, they are pretty scammyYeah.even USDT has a higher trading volume and liquidity than tether.> This is what he does with his time.\\n\\nAnd boy does he have a lot of it.  Some days he is on here for 16 hours straight shitposting and that is fairly much 7 days a week 365 days a year.\\n\\nI seriously do hope he is getting paid, there is no way he has time for anything else to provide an income.Check my other comment in this post.Hey goofuses, why don\\'t you try actually reading this board?What do you mean?I like BCH... I just like BTC better... simply because it is the driver of the entire crypto market.\\n\\nAlso, the trilemma will be solved. Kadena may have already solved it. In fact, Stuart Haber, footnoted three times in the Satoshi White Paper liked what he saw with KDA, he has joined the team as an advisor. Good times ahead.\\n\\nThe reason I am not a maxi is because I understand the simple fact that technology is always improved upon. As for BCH, increasing the blocksize is hardly a technical achievement.I mean, it‚Äôs his safe space. Leave this sub and you‚Äôre in a world where nobody even thinks about BCH.Because half the posts are from Egon, and he\\'s in his own little world./u/cryptocheckerIncreasing the block size is indeed a technical achievement: a lot of engineering and testing has gone into this. More importantly it preserves the development roadmap of the founding technical achiever in this space.\\n\\nBut sure...BTC is a \\'driver\\'. It\\'s [this kind of driver](https://youtu.be/GCA_exXkz6Q). Pay special attention to timecode 0:40 where you can spot the way it \\'drives\\' itself onto the Lightning Network.This is correct. I have been using coinbase for a while and it feels greatAh, I\\'m in UK so the deposits are pretty much instant with Faster Payments.I\\'ve changed my btc for tetherHuh?  I did not even mention BCH.So basically you looked only up your ass and saw no Tether apologists there, lol.Doesn‚Äôt work for BTC bag holders ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èLol... zoom out to reality. You may despise it... and that is legit... but acknowledge the reality. BTC is king. Even if we see greed and corruption, we can see the protocol has zero regard for the shit heads. Thank you, Bitcoin.You commented on the inordinate amount of time spent in this sub by its resident shit poster. I said he‚Äôs here all the time because he has no other viable place to go to feel that BCH is relevant.He literally said \"r/BTC\" in the post title, so where are the tether apologists here?Come on sweetheart, be honest! I bet you are getting paid in BTC.I think the EU is getting to the point where they can do instant transfers, but both (sender/recipient) banks have to support it.\\n\\nhttps://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/what-we-do/sepa-instant-credit-transferPlease, he is here to farm karma out of you because this sub is literally his entire life.In every Tether post I makeI\\'m guessing it\\'s either a different scheme, or Coinbase\\'s bank doesn\\'t support it yet, or their bank does but Coinbase doesn\\'t.This is an inspiring story, it will inspire many.cheers.Let\\'s be honest, this guy has found out if he says what he knows people want to hear they will give him money, lots of money. If read.cash was a BTC platform with BTC supporters he would be singing the praises of LN and writing numerous articles on why BCH is a scam.\\n\\nThis guy will drop BCH the second he stops getting the free money, just like he dropped this sub the second Reddit stopped him spamming his money making links here.That\\'s a great story.

So now I am watching the launch of AMMYI, they will have better conditions.Yeah but 99% are bitpay. Bch use on bitpay is falling in favor of Bitcoin and Litecoinwhat country is that?Until January of this year, I never used Bitcoin Cash. I\\'ve been using Bitcoin since 2012 and I used only BTC from then until 2021. Before this year, i.e. In 2019, I was a BCH hater and defended BTC simply because of the price being higher while BCH price had stayed roughly the same around $500-600. It wasn\\'t until the beginning of this year when I had 2 things happen that made me come to the realization that Bitcoin Cash was better for my uses:\\n         \\n1. I was trying to bet on the Superbowl, so I sent my transaction an hour before the game started. I paid $5+ for the fee and it didn\\'t confirm for over an hour due to being pushed back by others higher fees, meaning I missed the time to bet.          \\n\\n2. I was messing around with my wallets, converting/transferring between my phone and PC, and instead of sending BTC from my phone to my computer wallet, I accidentally sent it to the 2nd wallet on my phone. Not a big deal until you realize you paid $7 in fees for nothing. That was the tipping point for me to realize that BTC isn\\'t great to use as a peer to peer cash unless you are rich enough to afford high enough fees to always push transactions through the next block\\n         \\nThat\\'s when I realized BTC wasn\\'t the best coin to use as a medium of exchangecool story bro, keep holding this asset that is trending down, it was top 4-5 last cycle, now its top 20 or so, so see ya at top 100 next. Its cool you have low fees, but guess what plenty other shit has low fees, nano doge, who cares, in the end you want to hold an asset thats trending up.\\n\\nLighting network is for transactions, because you can settle in usd for 0 fees. Transacting without lighting network with volatile asset like bch, nano, doge whatever is not possible in real life, its just a gimmick, that you can use to pay for stuff, but its not scalable, because you don\\'t want to pay for coffee 3$ and then realize its worth 5$ next day.> Lighting network is for transactions, because you can settle in usd for 0 fees.

Your point about not wanting to pay $3 for coffee then the value go up applies no matter what layer you transact on\\n     \\nIf no one uses bitcoin or other cryptos then eventually the price will plummet because of price driven by speculation rather than use. I haven\\'t heard that mentality of never spending bitcoin until this year and I believe in the philosophy of spending and replacing because why would you never want to spend especially if you\\'ve 25x-10,000x your money? Regardless of profit, sometimes spending is good because there have been many years when cryptos been on a downward trend & you\\'d buy bitcoin and it was worth less a week later (not saying long term it doesn\\'t go up bc it obv has) but there have been situations throughout the years where transacting in bitcoin was the only option to interact with the market. \\n      \\nI think Satoshi gave you and I both a great gift of Bitcoin and they intended for it to be used. when you trade bitcoin for LN-BTC on lightning network you are going from using what Satoshi created, to a blockchain that Blockstream created. I believe everyone should have the ability to use bitcoin proper, i.e. the base layer, and for some people, the transaction fees can be cost prohibitive.\\n      \\n> Its cool you have low fees, but guess what plenty other shit has low fees, nano doge, who cares, in the end you want to hold an asset thats trending up.\\n       \\nThe block reward will keep halving and at a certain point, the network security of bitcoin will need to be maintained by transaction fees and because only about 300k transactions can go through a day, that will mean a constant rise in transaction fees rather than expansion from more people with lower fees\\n       \\n----------------------------------\\n       \\nThis is a short story addressing this point too, from Satoshi\\'s 2nd hand man and Bitcoin Lead Developer Gavin Andresen:        \\n       \\n> **A Possible BTC Future**:\\n        \\n>*Imagine: it is the year 2061.*\\n        \\n>The BTC price is six million US dollars‚Äì equal to about a million 2021 dollars because of inflation.\\n        \\n>Miners are being rewarded 0.006103515625 BTC per block, plus transaction fees of about 5 BTC for 4,000 or so transactions ($7,500 per transaction).\\n        \\n>But most BTC transactions don‚Äôt happen on the BTC network. Most BTC is locked up in multisignature outputs secured using multiparty computation and mirrored on another chain as ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù tokens. People moved their BTC either because they want faster transactions, lower fees, more privacy, or want to invest their BTC in decentralized financial stuff. Or maybe all of the above.\\n        \\n>The transactions that do occur on the main BTC network are high-value, mostly between super-whale-size holders (centralized exchanges, central banks, and the decentralized multiparty computation addresses that hold all the wrapped coins).\\n        \\n>These whales maintain the BTC network forever. They are the miners and the transaction creators; they don‚Äôt care how high transaction fees go, because they receive as many fees as they pay.\\n        \\n>In the year 2100 the whales notice that the mining reward is basically zero, and there are fewer and fewer transactions happening on the slow, expensive, zero-privacy BTC network. So they decide to simplify and save money by shutting it down.\\n        \\n>One by one, they shutdown the ‚Äúbridges‚Äù that move BTC between chains. Then they burn any BTC locked on the BTC chain by sending it to the 0x000‚Ä¶ address, to make sure nobody can ever spend it on the BTC network.\\n        \\n>Eventually, there are zero new BTC being produced on the BTC network, and zero BTC circulating on the BTC network. There is nothing left to secure, and the chain stops.\\n       \\n>But 20-or-so million BTC live on, circulating on other blockchains, valuable because there are a limited number of them and because BTC was the first scarce digital asset.Sorry I\\'m not interested in debating, because its a fact that bch is failed project, that would be waste of my time, just came to entertain myself by reading all the nonsense here.\\n\\nEDIT: Although its pretty tragic that you stole /r/btc handle and keep pretending here you are Bitcoin when you are Bitcoin Cash. Not only you are failed copycat that hasnt been relevant for years, but you continue to confuse new people in the space if they accidentally stumble upon this shithole.I wasn\\'t trying to debate you, I took the time to write my reply because I thought we were having a thoughtful discussion and I was looking forward to hearing your opinion on the issue I roseaint nobody got time for that, i can only guess what you have written is some regurgitated crap. Smartest people in the space have no problem with lighting, twitter implemented it, el salvador implemented it.My actual reply isn\\'t that long, it\\'s only 8 sentences, the second half is a story quoted from Gavin AndresenIt\\'s only 8 sentences cause you don\\'t know how to punctuate. That thing is long as fuck for something I don\\'t care about. And again as I said, all unbiased smart people have 0 problems with LN.In short, What\\'s the difference between transacting on layer 1 with a volatile asset (bch, eth, doge) and on layer 2 with a volatile asset (LN btc)?

Stupid metaphor there.Ya its bad, we need to focus more on ourselves.I think there‚Äôs more of us here than you think that are focused more on the positives of BCH and care less about the failings of other projectsJesus dudeSo you want to keep crying about BTC or actually talk about BCH? I have some BCH in my stack but this sub is just sad sometimes. I look at it and it looks like bitcoin derangement syndrome.> I believe this account is an ultra core minion. \\n\\nActually I have him marked and it is an ABC troll.If someone wants to actually put some effort in to make something of substance, then I\\'d agree.  What usually gets posted here is low effort sensationalist type posts.http://www.engineerguy.com/failure/betamax.htm\\n\\n> **Both machines solved the same problem:** How to store information compactly on a tape.\\n\\n\\n> So, if the machines are so similar why did Betamax lose to JVC? Many thought the betamax machine would win: It had the better image quality and the Betamax is decidedly better built.\\n\\n\\n> First, the **VHS was lighter than the Betamax**: 29 and a half lbs compared to 36 lbs for the this Betamax machine. That‚Äôs a huge difference for a mass manufactured object.\\n\\n\\n> Second, the earliest Betamax tapes played for only one hour, **VHS played for 2 hours -- enough time for a movie**. The ultimate killer, though, was the rental market.\\n\\n\\n> While, Betamax focused in its ads and energies on time shifting -- their ads featured headlines like ‚ÄúWatch whatever, whenever‚Äù -- while **JVC, the maker of the VHS system, created relationships** with the nascent video rental industry. When this market grew, VHS dominated in titles. While you could for a while find both formats eventually retailers began giving shelf space to the slightly more dominant brand, which then dominated even more.\\n\\n\\nI see many parallels................. seems like the tech that functions better, is easier, and is more accessible to the consumer wins, and that win is amplified by network effect...\\n\\nI wonder why Steam and Microsoft stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2017..?The main determining factor between Betamax and VHS was the cost of the recorders and recording time. Betamax is, in theory, a superior recording format over VHS due to resolution (250 lines vs. 240 lines), slightly superior sound, and a more stable image; Betamax recorders were also of higher-quality construction.***\\nu/tmw2442, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay24uld7tak9vzr9fguhm55ef68czgww2lnf0q) `0.000012 BCH` | `~0.01 USD` by u/KallistiOW\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).

You are knee deep in this but to the everyday person, bch looks like the whiney ex and the price action shows. If BTC dumps 50%, you can be sure BCH will dump more. If BCH dumps 50%, btc doesn\\'t even notice.I agree!Reddit works with up and downvotes. There is always a loud/salty minority.Jesus you guys are somethingNot quite true, they do talk about it, search rBitcoin and rCryptocurrency for BCH, Bitcoin cash, and Bcash and you\\'ll see. Not only that they have no problem  saying what are flat out provable lies, this is different than being critical of something, this is socal engineering.They don\\'t talk about BCH over there because you get banned if you do. LmaoThe fact that you personally are so loud about Tether is a good thing imo.  \\n\\n\\nBut I\\'d hate if everybody on the sub was like that.  \\n\\n\\nKeep doing your good work, but there\\'s more than one way to support BCH.

Don\\'t usually see it on the front page though. R/CC is just cancer though but vast majority of posts relate to BTC or alts. BCH has a much higher percentage of posts consistently on the front pages just crying about BTC and saying the teether/btc sky is gonna fall.Well said!üôåYou\\'re onto me. I am employing reverse troll psychology by posting pro bch content.That\\'s because this is an uncensored sub. It\\'s one of the few places you *can be critical of Bitcoin*.\\n\\nThis sub grew to what it is today because rBitcoin *censors* any mention of raising the blocksize or any mention of Bitcoin cash. BCH and Bitcoin cash are literally banned words in top posts on rBitcoin, they get auto flagged by their bot. The mods actually manually approve them if it so happens to be negative about the subject, say something positive and they ban you. This is how the socially engineer what people can and cannot talk about there. rBitcoin banned thousands of us just for talking freely about the blocksize. \\n\\nHere, you\\'re free to speak about any BTC fork. Allowing critical and/or supportive discussion is important if you don\\'t just want an echo chamber.\\n\\nIf you just want to see news about Bitcoin cash there is r/Bitcoincash> You\\'re onto me.

BCHIt\\'s depressing, <2017 100% of my crypto income was BTC, in 2021, even with BTCLN added as an option (that almost runs at a cost due to low use and having to run a separate server for it), the BTC income is now only around 5% with the rest mostly being made up of BCH and LTC.\\n\\nJust add lightning blah blah..\\n\\nHow is it even helpful when the main subs push this \"BUY HODL NEVER SPEND NEVER SELL\" BS?\\n\\nIf I removed the BTC options from my webstores it would save me one server and hardly affect me. There is no incentive for anybody to buy and spend BTC or BTCLN with me like on chain coins that are easy to obtain, and send, with low fees, I offer incentives like 15% discount for crypto, so a lot of people will genuinely go out and buy crypto to spend with me.. if that makes sense.\\n\\nI\\'m sick of seeing \"why would you spend Bitcoin\", \"bet the pizza guy feels stupid now\"..\\n\\nThe problem is the crypto space being flooded by newbie \"investors\" that are not really into crypto, certainly not into trying to replace fiat or use it for payments.. you need to remember, these are the exact type of people who called us all criminals, drug dealers, bitcoin is worthless etc...\\n\\n..until they saw the price rise and FOMO\\'d in from 2017 onwards.\\n\\nThey are literally the same people, those people are now the majority in the crypto space.\\n\\nIt\\'s beyond fixing IMHO.\\n\\nIt would be hard enough to fix even with the main socials/subs/sites on board.Bitcoin Cash.  100% OG Bitcoin.You are right , without using bitcoin in daily to daily ,we can\\'t expect it to hit total mainstream.I would love to use BTC!!!\\nThe only problem is that the high fees and lack of safe 0-conf prevent me from using it to make transactions like this\\n\\nu/chaintip\\n\\nSo I\\'m forced to use alternatives :(True this will boost the necessity of BTC and will help in many formsThis is the way to go! The experience we are having here is amazing and it creates a very strong community. I encourage anyone to do it.And El Salvador is doing this already, I am just curious to go there because my country is far behind.SPEND AND REPLACE\\n\\nthat\\'s how BTC became huge, nowadays no OGs are left thoLet\\'s explode a few myths, or at least I think they are myths. Here are the realities:\\n\\n1. Bitcoin holders do not want the price to \\'stabilise\\'. The more \\'stable\\' the price of Bitcoin, the unhappier they are. The price of BCH has been more stable than the price of BTC, but BTC holders are always in here complaining about that and trying to dunk on it because they prefer a price that is *less* stable -- mostly in the direction of \\'up\\'.\\n\\n2. Bitcoin\\'s price is not supposed to be stable. If it were, then it would not have a capped supply. Resources with an absolute limit on supply cannot have their prices stabilised. At best, it will become more stable, by experiencing its volatile motions more slowly, but it will never be \\'stable\\' like a resource with a centrally manipulable supply because price is an opinion and opinions can only be made \\'stable\\' if they are managed.\\n\\n3. More spenders of a currency for goods and services cannot directly stabilise its price in another currency. What stabilises price is more traders between currencies, simply because the more traders there are willing to exchange a currency at a certain price at any given moment, the less likely that price is to change immediately afterwards. (Note that this is not the same as there being more holders. If the holders do not trade then they will not stabilise the price; in fact, with a capped supply, more holders could lead to greater price **de**stabilisation by decreasing the liquidity available to trade.)OP is a jealous douche. If shoe was on other foot. BCH at $62,000 and BTC was at $650 you BCH people would be cumming in your pants. You BCH people would claim victory and laugh at BTC $650 price and claim that as proof it was a failure. You guys would laugh a BTC people who defended their low value with ‚Äúonce the world realizes‚Äù ‚Äúits not the price of the coin that matters‚Äù its a conspiracy they keep banning real info with propaganda‚Äù  ‚Äúthe tech is better‚Äù   Give me a break.The market cap is still just too low for a stable price... using it for payments won\\'t drive the mc up like shilling it to non-coiners would. My opinion.I share this opinion.\\n\\nBuild real adoption.That\\'s why we should do some with the digital currency to get the community.Exactly, the fastest and convenient to use, I prefer it first.BTC cash will help in growing it more and more and soon it will touch more height.And here we have what we are looking for in this post.It will also increase its circulation and more new wallets will be introduced.To clarify,  ONLINE merchant use is critical. Physical brick and mortar merchants are a dead end. \\n\\nPay for online services and purchases with bitcoin cash.You got hte right dude, it is BITCOIN CASH, the currency of buying.I agree, although perhaps the investment/price/gains mentality will ultimately help attract talent to the space? People who invest in crypto only, have a financial incentive to ensure it succeeds and gains wider adoption. Maybe, All the new attention and innovation will ultimately prove itself useful in building an ecosystem which actually helps the people who need it most to have a Decentralized, deflationary, peer to peer cash. The space is crazy right now and it can sometimes be sad to see, but maybe this is actually a positive in the long run? As more big money and institutions flood into the space, it becomes harder for people to ignore and regulate away, all the headlines introduce crypto to a few new people everyday. eventually when the big correction happens and the gains subsides and volatility decreases, from the ashes will arise a peer to peer cash which everyone knows about and is comfortable to use.This has always been the flaw in a digital currency with a fixed supply. Increased adoption on any sort of scale will dramatically increase the price. An asset whose price is capable of dramatic price increases will attract investors (not ‚Äúusers‚Äù). The price volatility will serve as an impediment to its use because no sane person would spend an appreciating asset if there is a massively depreciating fiat alternative.\\n\\nThis is the challenge that BCH or any other purported means of exchange will have to solve.Bitcoin cash is everywhere we just need the eyes and dare to have it.***\\nu/EducationalAnus, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay2kl7cuua5jdfj5j3xlrrlwzwqehu48vgtjdq) `0.00055147 BCH` | `~0.35 USD` by u/rshap1\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).

You idiots and trolls don\\'t spend your time on other coins telling them to sell and that they are \"WRONG!!!!\"\\n\\nHilariously you seem to spend almost 1/2 your time posting here about how much you hate BCH. You would not do that if you didn\\'t know that BCH is the real Bitcoin and as such is the biggest threat to the bullshit BTC chain.If the tables were turned, nobody would give BTC a second thought. There would be no \"store of value\" or \"digital gold\" narrative. People would be happy to transact in BCH because it **actually works as intended.**  \\n\\n\\nYou say this like it\\'s a bad thing. Lol.  \\n\\n\\nIf the price of goddamn anything, on any market, was actually dictated by the fundamentals of that thing, and not speculation and market manipulation, we\\'d all be ecstatic... you would be too!True stuff, many OP are really really jealous in this case..Shill it to non-coiners by showing them what they can use it for. :)  \\n\\n\\nI think that\\'s the #1 thing my friends ask when I explain crypto to them. \"What does it **do**?\" \"What can I **spend it on**?\"  \\n\\n\\nI can explain how it works, and what its philosophy is, but that\\'s not what most people care about. Why would someone buy something they can\\'t use for anything?  \\n\\n\\nThat\\'s why Bitcoin Core invented the \"store of value\"/\"digital gold\" narrative. Suddenly, BTC gets a use case: make you rich quick.  \\n\\n\\nBut... can anyone truly explain WHY Bitcoin will make you rich, in detail?  \\n\\n\\nIf they can... then I personally think that the truth naturally would lead them to Bitcoin Cash.it is called Bitcoin Cash (BCH), never heard of BTC cash except as such described in the whitepaperAnd here i m to praise you and after this you will praise meWhy not physical stores?Online transactions are the obvious starting point. But there\\'s no reason that we can\\'t use Bitcoin in meatspace, too :)But why\\'s that?? Do physical stores gets problem with it????Their will be solution for that so we should not get so scared in starting.I think it attracts bankers, government attention/regulation, rich people, and degenerate gamblers mostly, a lot of the crowd I really dislike TBH, a lot of people from traditional money.\\n\\nI don\\'t think it attracts much if any talent, just greed and ignorance.. and more parasites trying to milk everything they can from the coin/crypto space... it\\'s horrible to watch.\\n\\nI\\'ll never support the crypto as an asset or stock way of thinking TBH.Optimistic outlook. I can say I personally got back into crypto with this bullrun because my friends started talking about it again. I somehow missed 2017, all I remember hearing is about Facebook\\'s Libra and how Steam and MS no longer accept Bitcoin for reasons I never looked into.  \\n\\n\\nI\\'m a developer and I have a wallet from 2011 that I don\\'t remember the passphrase to. Sad times.  \\n\\n\\nSo yeah, I think the speculation snowball will also bring in true interest by proxy.Yeah I see that now, as sad as it may seem I\\'ve gone from wanting mass adoption, as in loads of stores accepting it etc.. but now days I\\'m more wanting to just keep it more private, I\\'ve gone beyond caring about anything but myself, my customers and the coins that are still usable for me. The past with BTC made me hate the general public more than anything else. I just feel like as soon as they see dollar signs they come and mess everything up.\\n\\nThere are only really 3 usable coins for me now days and I only like 2 of the projects.\\n\\nI realise I probably sound bitter about it.Damn 4 mil bitcoiners are so good and satisfying, I wish I could live thereIf no one is trading it at all then yes obviously the price cannot move -- trades are what move the price -- but I don\\'t think *zero* trading is the kind of \\'stability\\' anyone is after because it would be a sign of weakness and general disinterest. People want Bitcoin to be desired, and it probably will continue to be, so it looks like the only way to greater price stability (if that is genuinely what you want) would be to make more trades available, not fewer. Anyway, *zero* trading rarely happens: when Bitcoin\\'s price is not moving much in any particular direction and is mostly just bouncing back and forth, the buying and the selling pressures have reached temporary equilibrium.Yeah make moves and make things stabilize when no one is interested in it.I guess op really likes his Amazon overlords and loathes mom and pop small businesses.I don\\'t think you sound bitter, or at least not reasonably so.  The desire for a non-fiat, decentralized digital currency for fast, cheap, and borderless transactions is a very understandable thing. \\n\\nI have wanted to see such a thing for a long time, as I came to see the absurdity (and in some cases impossibility) of the existing system to handle all types of needed transactions.  I\\'ve just been very skeptical that it\\'s going to happen any time soon, and that has created many clashes in this sub.\\n\\nFor quite some time I\\'ve argued that BTC should not be the focus of this sub, as it is not incompatible but potentially complimentary precisely because I don\\'t see it as a legitimately workable means of exchange. People can hold most of their assets in a store of value and still utilize a different means of exchange.\\n\\nUnlike BCH proponents, my issue isn\\'t an objection to a 2nd layer solution (which most people would be fine using because most people don\\'t hold a religious-like zeal for pure peer to peer exchanges).  Instead, my issues are the same ones that makes me question the viability of BCH as a means of exchange: price volatility is inevitable if there is any sort of adoption, price volatility presents risk to buyers and sellers alike that will create disincentives, and every transaction (in most countries) will create a tax-reportable event that makes this completely impractical. \\n\\nSo much of the debate centers on whether a particular crypto works, technologically, as a MoE (hence all the crapping on BTC for being slow and having high fees). To me, that\\'s a superficial issue, because the mere fact that a crypto *can work* (technologically) as a MoE does not make it practical for such uses...and until those other issues are resolved, I think it\\'s mostly going to just be a small universe that actually uses crypto for transactions (which, by the way, is totally fine, but just not what most people wanted to see).My issue with it all is just I\\'ve accepted crypto for nearly a decade, and things keep making it harder and harder to use as peer to peer cash, like the direction BTC went in, the fact it\\'s all been regulated as an asset/stock and like you say a taxable event on spending in many countries, I blame that on the masses.. because..\\n\\n..no wonder the governments think it\\'s an asset/stock when 95% of the crypto space also have this mindset, and none of them explain it to others as p2p cash.\\n\\nTheir greed and ignorance, and normalisation of KYC and other things that destroy all the good things about the coin/s, just breaks and wrecks everything.\\n\\nNot to mention how annoying and toxic a lot of these people can be, I still need to keep reminding myself to be careful who I talk to in certain subs, you will try having a conversation with somebody and it will just devolve into them name calling etc... and them arguing to you about things they don\\'t really understand.\\n\\nJust parrots who think they are experts after reading r bitcoin for a year and a half.\\n\\nI hope to see things change, like the way it\\'s taxed in certain situations for a start.\\n\\nImagine trying to do the accounts for a mining pool...\\n\\n..maybe driving it more underground again is a good thing.\\n\\nI just don\\'t want BCH, XMR or LTC disrupted.\\n\\nSmall universe is fine for me.I feel you, on all counts.  In an ideal world we\\'d at least be able to exempt transactions below a certain threshold from tax reporting, but I\\'m not optimistic about that simply because of the threat something like that could pose (in the eyes of the very regulators who would need to authorize that change in the law) to their underlying fiat.  It may work in smaller countries that use USD as their base currency (e.g., El Salvador) but lack the ability to impact monetary policy.  \\n\\nBut for those countries/regions who do have their \"own\" fiat, I don\\'t see this change happening simply because it would be effective in undercutting the monopoly that fiat enjoys.\\n\\nI\\'m hopeful that a path forward will be found and that my cynicism will be proven to be wrong.I think my long term solution will probably just be to move countries.\\n\\nSadly I can\\'t go there, but AU looks appealing to me for crypto adoption, food, hotels, and services I\\'d actually use.. they don\\'t have the same tax issue.\\n\\nAnother issue is people accepting crypto but using services like BitPay and similar. They KYC your customers now days, I tried buying some GPUs recently on [scan.co.uk](https://scan.co.uk) and they hit me with it on a ¬£450 order, was easier to back out and pay by card.\\n\\nI like the way [prompt.cash](https://prompt.cash) promotes non-custodial method, I use a similar method myself on my payment gateways using the xPUB key from HD wallets.\\n\\nBitPay and similar also suffer from the fact they have rules similar to PayPal, you can\\'t use it to sell many high risk products, it defeats the point for me.\\n\\nI spend a lot of crypto on places like [fasttech.com](https://fasttech.com) they use their own payment system with no third parties, you also get extra bonus points when paying with crypto.Notice that besides 202k BTC they also have 202k BCH that will be distributed to creditors.A plan is a plan until the money is returned to the hands of the creditors. Plans are moot.\\n\\nIf in doubt, refer to Evergrande.What will they gonna do with whole that thing now, better to distribute it.This could be the triggering event leading to bitcoin losing its #1 position in the market.I was just reading yesterday that the court case isn\\'t even set yet - is it?Smh if you can‚Äôt trust your money with the magic the gathering online exchange who can you trust these days.I think they gonna make the position down for a moment.The Mt.Gox trial is coming to an end, making millionaires galore to those who were made ‚ÄúHODLers by force‚Äù all these years.The most epic dump of all times!And what about BTG and XEC?And which will be sold, thus hurting the price.I wonder how hard BCH will tank after the coins are released... it will be interesting for sure.And people here argue that BCH wasn\\'t an airdrop...\\n\\nSome got it for free, and some paid real hard earned money for it.>This could be the triggering event leading to bitcoin losing its #1 position in the market.\\n\\nHow so? I doubt all of the 200k bitcoin and 200k bch are going to flood the market at once or hit a single exchange at the same time. It would only be a portion of the total and that portion distributed across a few exchanges. It could bring some selling pressure but if bitcoin price goes lower, so does the overall market. \\n\\nEven if the price of bitcoin was cut in half (62k down to 31k which is not impossible and could happen), Eth would have to still gain a few hundred dollars even when the whole market is crashing.I will use my MtGox BCH and BTC as they are meant to be used: Will spend the BCH and buy BTC :Dthere are much better and more severe reasons why that will probably happen -namely tether. It\\'s looking grim at this point, it\\'s full copium mode for moonboisLOL, not to BCH but Etherium.Although BTC may lose its number one position in the cryptocurrency market in the short term, the probability of a BTC crash is very low.Wondering about the name? The outfit started as Magic: The Gathering Online Exchange!XLM and obyte are on this what about list, but I think all eligible for airdrops.and BSV the coin that shall not be named?It\\'s an opportunity if you believe in the overall principles of the coin, a short liquidity burst. an opportunity to get a bigger piece of the pie.Yip, XEC will suffer too after its pump from 16 to 160 gets extinguished, BSV too will suffer.It wasn\\'t an airdrop. It was a clean chain split.BTC was the airdrop, if you want to think like that, it\\'s just perspective. if BTC resembled the white paper it would be the other way around.I\\'m not saying it will crash to 0. But even if only 50k to 100k BTC are sold within a few months I think this could bring bitcoin down quite significantly. Set\\'s say BTC goes down 30-40% over the next 6 months because of higher sell pressure during that period. This comes pretty close to the time of the ethereum merge where a big supply shock is expected. The ETH issuance will be reduced to about 1.5k ETH/day (from currently 15k ETH/day). This is less than what\\'s currently burned by EIP1559..! So I expect ETH to go up during that same period as it has a sudden reduction in issuance that\\'s roughly equivalent with 3 halvings. This in combination with BTC sell pressure of suddenly released BTC could make BTC lose #1. I know a lot of ifs.. obviously not certain this will happen but I personally think the chances aren\\'t so small.But you have to know that BTC is currently the largest cryptocurrency, and BTC is limited. There are still some BTCs that have not been mined, which means that BTC has some room for development.But I pay more attention to ETH. I think the development trend of ETH will be better. This is the cryptocurrency that I have been pursuing.Yep, I know about Mt Gox. And I kind of envy those people for being into forced BTC HODL. \\n\\nIf I had 2 or 3 BTC back in that time, I\\'d probably waste them by buying the \"hot new shit\", like the now forgotten altcoins such as XMR, BCH, or LTC.BTC hodlers got BCH for free, without paying for it or putting any work into it. To me that\\'s completely unfair.\\n\\nBasically you\\'ve given BCH into the hands of BCH enemies (Bcore), so that they can dump it on their leisure.\\n\\nPerhaps starting from genesis block would\\'ve been better?you are also not factoring in the amount of people in the sidelines wait for that drop(if it does drop).That supply shock should be priced in already> There are still some BTCs that have not been mined, which means that BTC has some room for development.\\n\\nThis is either a non-sequitur statement or something was lost in translation.\\n\\n*\"Because there are still 2 million more bitcoin left to be mined over the next hundred+ years therefore bitcoin has room for development\"*\\n\\ncan you rephrase it or add more context to get your point across?By that logic BCH holders got BTC for free.I expected BTC to lose spot 1 next year anyway. The released mtgox BTC just give me more confidence in itI think it isn\\'t, but the big chunks will go into dark pools. some exchanges may get recked is lots of people cash out like a MtGox repeat ripple.maybeUh.. No? BTC started in 2009, BCH started in 2017. If you were a BTC hodler, you got rewarded by receiving BCH, BSV, XEC dividends. If you were holding BCH since 2021, you got nothing. \\n\\nTechnically you might say that BCH is the same chain as BTC, but they don\\'t hold the same ticker, and sadly it\\'s the ticker (and also the higher price == higher hashrate) that decides what Bitcoin is. \\n\\nBcore doesn\\'t care about the whitepaper nor what Bitcoin was created for. Current narrative is that BCH forked off BTC, not the other way around. Or that neither BTC nor BCH are the original Bitcoin.>I expected BTC to lose spot 1 next year anyway. The released mtgox BTC just give me more confidence in it\\n\\nHow much confidence? \\n\\nremindme! one year #1 by market cap is?> Uh.. No? BTC started in 2009, BCH started in 2017. \\n\\nThe BCH ticker started some time in 2017 and the BTC ticker probably in 2010, as at first bitcoin didn\\'t have a ticker.\\n\\nBut the bitcoin chain started in 2009 and in 2017 it split into two. Deciding to call the initial chain BTC and then one of the two forks also BTC doesn\\'t make it more original than the one you don\\'t call BTC. Both new chains have common history between 2009-2017. \\n\\nSo yes, if the big block chain had won and had received the BTC ticker, then by the same logic it would seem that the segwit chain was the airdrop. \\n\\n----\\n\\n> If you were a BTC hodler, you got rewarded by receiving BCH, BSV, XEC dividends. If you were holding BCH since 2021, you got nothing. \\n\\nIt\\'s kinda the other way around. If you held BCH after 2017, you received BSV and XEC. If you held *only* BTC (selling your BCH), you got nothing. \\n\\n> and sadly it\\'s the ticker that decides what Bitcoin is. \\n\\nSadly, to the majority of newbies that is the deciding factor.

For the next 5 years around 98%.I remember people claiming right around every difficulty adjustment, how miners would switch chains and [bitcoin would grind to a halt and deathspiral](http://np.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/8ny3u6/altcoin_discussion_saturday_june_02_2018/dzzxfck/) which would lead to \"the flippining\". \\n\\nWhen pressed for an date when that would *actually* happen or for people to put their money where their mouth is, they get pretty quiet.\\n\\nWhat you are proposing is of a similar vein but now the goalposts have been moved to Eth taking the top spot? is this right?No it hasn\\'t really anything to do with each other. Also I never thought that scenario you describe is likely to happen (at least within the next ~120 years)How do you see it going down? What leads to the fall from the top spot and what do you think will be in the #1 spot in 5 years?SoV is not enough. To stay #1 a chain needs to offer more utility than that.

But eth\\'s EIP1559 with its fee burn mechanism is a good example how transactional/computational utility beyond SoV can channel back into enhanced SoV properties of a coin. There will simply be no reason to hold a coin long term because of low/close to 0 inflation beyond speculation when there\\'s one with negative inflation (made possible because people pay for other utilities the chain provides).>SoV is not enough.

Be aware.I apologize for all these spams. Im currently changing my password as my account was hijacked.So he was a victim as well. It was most likely not posted by him. I saw multiple other accounts do the same. I myself am a victim of these hacks. Even tho i have 0 interest in crypto i just one day woke up with notifications that i was spamming on r/bitcoin. And now here.You are correct. That\\'s why I am secretly accumulating as much Bitcoin Cash as possible.It\\'s simply explained like this: BTC is bitcoin-the-brand, BCH is bitcoin-the-tech.\\n\\nOn BTC the fees are high *by design*, and are only sometimes low.\\n\\nBTC maximalists boycott any business that accepts other crypto, so that businesses are afraid of adding more crypto.> 1) Why doesn\\'t Enjin wallet support BCH? Any insight? Any solid BCH wallets to recommend?\\n\\nDunno, often times BTC crowd don\\'t want to admit there is competition let alone show off how superior it is.\\n\\n> 2) How THE HECK did BTC Core outpace the adoption of BCH????? I feel like I\\'ve had my eyes opened now. Why aren\\'t more people wanting to ditch Core for Cash?\\n\\nBecause people buy trusted brands, and BTC luckily got the brand.  Also, they don\\'t actually spend crypto just HODL it so the difference doesn\\'t occur to them.\\n\\n> 3) Once more people catch on... shouldn\\'t Core\\'s support dwindle.\\n\\nYes.  That\\'s why BTC market dominance has been declining for years, and it will continue given long enough.\\n\\n> 4) Anything else worth pointing out to me? Am I missing anything obvious here?\\n\\nhttps://bitcoincashpodcast.com/faqsThe scaling war did go on for years which left a lot of bad blood on both sides. BTC did win trough censorship. And they captured the ticker the name and the attention. Many services still to this day don\\'t use BCH because they believed the lies that BCH is a scam.\\n\\nThe best way is to just write the services and friendly demand they add BCH.\\n\\nThere is little adoption on BTC there was even a lot of negative adoption in 2017 when the fees and transaction times rose for the first time. \\n\\nBCH just had to start from nothing again and catch up.\\n\\n3 Yep, petty much. But at the moment it is mostly just speculation for more fiat. Real adoption or fundamentals don\\'t matter much at the moment. But that will change.\\n\\n\\nhttp://bestbchwallets.com/walletsyou might want to look at [electroncash.org](https://electroncash.org), me I do prefer the portables>I tried to send a transaction through and the minimum my hot wallet (Enjin) would let me set was 17 cents CAD and took 24 hours to be mined and confirmed\\n\\nLol. This tip will cost me a fraction of a penny to send and it will be instant. u/chaintipBCH is the actual continuation of the original Bitcoin but people haven‚Äôt realized it yet so it‚Äôs super low in price ü§∑\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è Crazy shit but true. Maybe one day they‚Äôll figure it outI use the bitcoin.com wallet on ios.Weird how me and you both came here looking for answers recently. I think the mainstream leaves people like us thirsting for the truth.1. Electron-cash (Electrum) is my choice\\n2. Pretty sure there are more physical goods stores accepting BCH than BTC, if not only because people automatically add BTC as well as other coins when adding crypto options. I don\\'t count institutional adoption as adoption like those in r/bitcoin, to me institutional adoption is the people I wanted to avoid getting into crypto and trying to milk it for everything they can, they just want more fiat money, not crypto adoption, they are traditional money.\\n3. I doubt support for the main BTC ticker and brand name will ever completely die, they only care about which is worth the most. That is literally all they care about.\\n4. Core devs are sell outs and r/bitcoin promote toxicity towards other coins and projects, they manipulate the masses by censoring certain discussions and pushing their own narrative to the millions of newbies in there that don\\'t know any better.\\n5. I\\'ve accepted BTC on webstores for a decade now, but apparently I\\'m a shitcoiner as I was forced to add BCH, LTC and ETH in 2017 due to the price rise/congestion, and high fees.2) with money the most important thing is trust and not fundamentals. BTC managed to keep the respected brand Bitcoin and also had good propaganda campaign against BCH. The BCH side made several severe P.R. mistakes (for example I consider the \"Bitcoin Cash is the real Bitcoin\" claim to be one of them) and had internal turmoil and experienced two other forks. So trust was undermined. In addition it does appear that the market values store of value function more than the payment function so the loss of utility in BTC did not really affect it as much as it should have if people wanted to use it as money. Finally BCH has competitors which also provide fast and cheap transactions. BTC lost dominance but that loss went to multiple coins.\\n\\n3) not if the market decides store of value is what it wants and values. I hope the tide turns and people start to use and value crypto payments more. Who knows?\\n\\n4) one thing I realized in the years since the fork is that immutability itself has value. I came to this conclusion after the turmoil in BCH and its two forks. Yeah you\\'ll be stuck with outdated tech and wrong decisions if you never change the protocol but there is value in something that never changes.one thing I realized in the years since the fork is that immutability itself has value.

That\\'s why BTC market dominance has been declining for years, and it will continue given long enough.And the question thing will make the thing more understand able, because it clear the points.You never could keep our secret could you.Yeah ture, I\\'m holding as much as possible BCH and planning to get more whenever the price go down!Holy hell. Lol. Roger Ver always came across so poorly that I didn\\'t pay attention to the tech differencesI think I also have to do this but who knows what\\'s its future is.Great analogy. I\\'m still blown away right now.> On BTC the fees are high by design, and are only sometimes low.\\n\\nThe *sometimes low* periods represent *peak risk*.\\n\\nIt is when there is a huge floating balance of BTC on the exchanges and there is no use for real blockchain trxs because all price action is merely buying and selling on the exchanges. These times are really dangerous for BTC because they represent *peak risk* as the threat of another Mt. Gox moment looms. The #1 rule, *not your keys not your coins*, is being ignored.\\n\\nIt\\'s sad, the only time BTC has purpose is when it isn\\'t used as Bitcoin was intended.\\n\\ncc /u/the_mighty_chewbaccaBtc fees are high because to stop small gain and to earn higher amount and sell on high and earn bigWhen you have all your crypto on roobinhood it\\'s funny how cheap the fees are huh? /sI still did\\'nt get the 2nd point, can you explain it in brief??Until recently I believe those lies.

I understand this...\\n\\nBut why does this mean MORE risk? Please expand. I\\'m curious to understand this....Ah yes, BTC the electronic peer to peer, fiat-in fiat-out speculator enrichment system.When BCH and BTC split, they both were \"Bitcoin\".  But for a number of different and mostly luck based reasons, BTC ended up being called \"Bitcoin\" and BCH had to rename to \"Bitcoin Cash\".  Since that time, lots of people who don\\'t know the difference just assume BTC is \"the original\" and BCH is a \"knock off\", and people dislike knock offs, so they pile in to BTC without doing any research, even if BCH is a better coin.  That won\\'t last forever, but it will last a long time until the majority of people actually start spending crypto to buy stuff and they need to know how it works.\\n\\nIf you buy BTC on Coinbase and never buy a banana with it, then you don\\'t know or care if fees to use it are $0.0005, $5 or $5000.  So this is what most BTC people are like, hence they are unconcerned if fees are ridiculous.üëçThanks. I have to figure out how to claim this.You don\\'t decide the transaction fee with BCH. The fee is automatically cheap and the transaction is instant. It\\'s the way Bitcoin was designed. Bitcoin BTC used to always be free and instant. It wasn\\'t until blockstream took over bitcoin core and purposely handicapped Bitcoin. Deliberately made it expensive, slow and insecure. Why would they do that? So they could push their \"solution\" onto people... The Lightning Network. Where they can make money off people on transaction fees forever. And have absolute control over the money supply.[I quit!

Got anymore historically significant posts, out of curiosity?I am curious. But I will surely check your link and see what u tried to show us.I mean... I understand the risk to the users of the exchanges that are keeping their coins on it. That is risk to be hacked or robbed. Is this what you mean?\\n\\nBut to the network and blockchain its self the risks are the same right? Or near negligible...You\\'re on the right track.\\n\\nThe whole point of Bitcoin and the blockchain is the personal control of wealth, no longer needing permissioned, custodial accounts controlled by banks (middlemen). The way this works is you have the private keys to your wallet and control the fate of your capital.\\n\\nOf course, if you want to exchange your coins for classic fiats, then you need to sign up for a custodial account to participate on an exchange. When you deposit your coins, you cede control to the exchange, hence *not your keys, not your coins.* You\\'ve now entered into a risk relationship with the exchange, as there\\'s no guarantee you can retrieve the balance of your coins. This was an early, hard lesson learned from the disaster that was the Mt. Gox exchange.\\n\\nAs frenzy around price action builds, the exchanges amass large sums of coins, controlled by them and not the \"owners\", making this collectively a peak risk period. It\\'s a time when some exchanges bet with the house funds, and begin fractional reserve policies.Just reply to the DM you got from chaintip with a BCH wallet address and chaintip will send it to you.

Thank you for your time so far.You karma shills dont give up do you.This is not up to date, as they\\'ve raised another $210M this June/August.Asking questions is always good.\\n\\nI don\\'t really know much about the lawsuits. My best guess is that a guy that pretends to be Satoshi (Wright) is suing everyone ala patent troll or something. I know he did in the past, not sure if it\\'s still going on, and if that what Mr Maxwell referred to.Greg Maxwell and Craig Steven Wright are both state actors playing a game.Me and him had an interesting discussion here on reddit recently. I wonder if he will remember me. In a few short days I\\'ve found a place where I can ask any question, understand the issues and criticize someone like him in a meaningful way without fear of retribution. I hope he understands the power of a decentralized community now, someone like me can give him a lecture and no one tries to remove me or tell me I can\\'t criticize him. They  think we worship satoshi, but they are the ones who will not change the code out of irrational fear.> I don\\'t really know much about the lawsuits.\\n\\nSee my comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qdzen1/follow_up_question_on_block_size_and_mining_fees/hhqjf0z/One thing you will likely learn, either by reading what I am about to type or through your own research, is that OneMeg is a destroyer. His first, or nearly first opinions on Bitcoin and it\\'s decentralized governance, was that it was/is untenable; then he went about proving it by trying to destroy it.\\n\\nHe is very good at destroying. He\\'s very good at seeming to be honest, but it is only a semblance of honesty.\\n\\nThe lawsuits he was alluding to were lawsuits filed by CSW against developers. Here\\'s an excerpt... notice the specific language he uses...\\n\\n> Interestingly, their now ~$7 billion dollar lawsuit targets several former Bitcoin developers who haven\\'t been active for years such as myself, along with some more recently active ones like Jonas, and it also targets the eCash (bcash-tax) developers Sechet and Cox-- **yet doesn\\'t target a single BCH developer.**\\n\\nHe states \"doesn\\'t target a single BCH developer\" yet that\\'s sophistry. OneMeg created the sophistry by placing Sechet into a specific group, \"the eCash (bcash-tax)\". When, in fact, Sechet was a BCH developer when the lawsuit was originally filed. OneMeg is aware of this, but conveniently leaves that information out. He hopes you, and everyone else that is not intimately familiar with this specific history, will accept his skewed and fabricated narrative.\\n\\nBe very wary of anything he communicates; it is invariably filled with half truths, distortions, misrepresentations, and chicanery.\\n\\nA fair number of us have been reading that crap for nearly a decade.\\n_____\\n**Edit:** \\nAlso... notice the 7 billion amount. That\\'s a scary number, isn\\'t it? Do you know where that number comes from? OneMeg pulled it out of thin air. Or, in the event that he did some math, that 7 billion is the total number of all the amounts CSW hoped, but has not and will not, to recover in his malicious defamation lawsuits. Some of the lawsuits have already been dismissed. OneMeg knows this, but he uses that scary number to create his false narrative.Most of my life I believed that people were irredeemable and that they never change. That might be mostly true, but I\\'ve learned that it is possible for people to change. \\n\\nI think going through my post history it would seem I was easily told what to believe, because I seem to agree with so much. But what he dosent see is how many questions I had to ask to get here. How many nights I spent just thinking about everything, as a complete nobody with no connection to anything. How many times I almost gave up, losing hope due to the misinformation and empty shilling. I don\\'t think he could even begin to imagine how far my journey had to take me for us to be on an equal field. He could never have the same appreciation for the platform that puts us on equal footing, because it would only serve to level him. \\n\\nIn our discussion he tried to tell me what to believe and I quickly dismissed him and invited him to continue discussing the topic I was bringing him. He really had no words to address the complexities I explored with him. I designed my words to hopefully inspire him to see things differently.\\n\\nI would actually say that I believe he listened to me. I feel like he wasn\\'t sure what to make of the things I said to him, but the conviction that I had that day is seldom seen in history. On that day a king bowed to a peasant, and had no choice but to accept my lecturing. I hope that memory can plant the seed of hope for him one day. I still believe in him, even if no one else will. Even if he doesn\\'t. \\n\\nAll of us deserve to have someone believe in us. I wont give up on anyone, unless they have given up on themselves.>A fair number of us have been reading that crap for nearly a decade.\\n\\nI know it must have seemed hopeless for some time. I will not forget the faith you and others like you have carried for so long.They released propaganda cartoons in response. \\n\\nThey are scared shitless and trying to downplay this.\\n\\nIf any of their low paid employees has any info they will go for the bounty and tether is not in the business of paying their low employees 1 Million dollars to keep their mouths shut.What I have never understood is how are they purchasing $60B worth of commercial paper? At what rates? My vote is still \"thin air\" with CP being very insignificant portion of the \"reserves\"\"attestations are not good enough\"\\n\\nThey quote that as if its a ridiculous statement. These are so called cypherpunks using tether huh.I\\'ve read through masses of responses to the linked Hindenberg tweet and it\\'s still \\'20 hours ago\\'. Could you link to Tether\\'s response please?This is a great--private, not public--way to handle unscrupulous businesses like Tether that don\\'t involve government regulations.Make it $10,000,000 and maybe I‚Äôll talk lol.xd to this.this is hilarious   Gensler will top your $1 offer just to keep any such details (or lack thereof) private   scam technology protected by scam govt \"regulator\"This whole situation with Tether makes me laugh.

At present, many countries support cryptocurrency to pay all bills, but I think the risk of BTC paying the so-called bills is very high, which means that the country‚Äôs GDP will be As the price of BTC fluctuates, if BTC collapses one day, this country will suffer an unprecedented disaster. This is one of the reasons why China does not support investment in cryptocurrency.\\r  \\nCryptocurrency was developed in the United States. At present, only the United States and other countries can control the future trend of cryptocurrency. If all exchanges or wallets in the United States collapse overnight, then the era of cryptocurrency is undergoing a crash.So much gibberish...But why?Current BCH price is $644.39, LOW :- $609.12 / HIGH :- 653.18, i.e roughly 5.51%.https://fintel.io/ss/us/bchg\\n\\nRecord of 282,194 BCHG shares were shorted yesterday, also the price was 10%-20% below the BCH market price already, which makes no sense to short. If they really think BCH would go down then they should short regular exchanges for 20% more profit if they are correct.Maybe because some stock investors can see it is undervalued and since BTC just make ATH they are anticipating what happened in the first part of the bull run. I\\'m tempted to place a leveraged long on BCH.I don\\'t care about Why unless it\\'s kissing it\\'s value.Because all of the Grayscale trusts are at 10-20% undervalued to the underlying asset (BTC, BCH, ETH, etc) due to the trust being very inefficient at tracking the spot price and fees. There is renewed talk about Grayscale switching to a ETF format instead of a trust (awaiting approval from SEC, has been denied multiple times already). If approved the prices will better match spot prices.BCH is on a long run. Hopefully it gets into track it seems.Do it while you can...Do you have one?Not currently leveraged but I hear news that it\\'s getting shutdown possibly soon for US customersWhich exchange?We don‚Äôt support the HindenburgResearch community, which is rooted in principles of shadiness and backhanders. \\n\\nHindenburg‚Äôs opacity undermines the movement it claims to be a part of.\\n\\nWe thank everyone for their submissions as we continue to investigate if they have a position.You‚Äôve shorted multiple miners and now an actual crypto currency.

What\\'s wrong with Bitfinex?And what do you mean by that. That I need to run to another exchange? I\\'m not going to leave Bitfinex. And anti-advertising does not need to be distributedYeah but How long will it take for tether to fall? I mean the evidence is out there already.Documentation filed 14th October 2021, so information to public is only now available. Also the trial is scheduled to begin early next year.Those exchanges aren\\'t acquiring USDT for equivalent $.  \\n\\n[from CFTC statement...](https://twitter.com/BennettTomlin/status/1449469628162445314?s=20)\\n\\n>More interesting to me are the Tether revelations. First and most interestingly we learn that Tether was backed less frequently than previously assumed, with only having sufficient backing for about every 1 day in 4 during the examined period\\n\\n>Another fascinating insight was into how Tether does business, with them having 51 different arrangements for others to hold Tether funds, with 29 of them having no written contract or agreement. A strange arrangement for what was at the time a multi billion dollar enterprise\\n\\n>We also finally get definitive confirmation that Crypto Capital Corp, alleged money launderers for the Colombian cartels, were holding Tether reserves (a hypothesis that I had publicly shared previously: \\n\\n>We also learned that Tether started using commercial paper and other assets as part of their reserves much earlier than we had previously known. It also revealed that they would give their clients Tethers before they had actually received the wire\\n\\n>It also appears that Tether was frequently derelict in their own recordkeeping. They appear to at several times have not known what their own reserves were, and note that the transparency page was not accurately updated daily as promised\\n\\n>Interesting addendum to that, the Tether transparency page has been wrong for years and is wrong today, and many including myself and CasPiancey have tried to notify them, even going as far as to tell a former executive so that they could update it. They have failed to do so\\n\\nand that\\'s when Tether\\'s marketcap was less than 5% of today\\'s marketcap.Bitfinex and tether are the same company under Ifinex. This was hidden until it became disclosed in the [Paradise Papers.](https://news.bitcoin.com/paradise-papers-reveal-bitfinexs-devasini-and-potter-established-tether-already-back-in-2014/)>Those exchanges aren\\'t acquiring USDT for equivalent $.\\n\\nnone of those are exchanges fyi, and nothing in the text you copied says they weren\\'t acquiring USDT for equivalent $. And all of those people have said explicitly they\\'ve sent tether billions of dollars.Not that BCH requires a centralised company to do this, but if it has a good way of withdrawing the underlying then its just like a regular exchange.Come on. Let the ghost chains die off already. XdddWhy would you want an ETF on ETC it‚Äôs a dead chain is it not?The trust holds the tokens and manages the ETF. You buy shares of the etf on a broker. It‚Äôs all done in fiat, this isn‚Äôt a way to convert fiat to crypto.\\n\\nUnless they start offering tokenized shares of the etf and then you exchange those for crypto on defi then you won‚Äôt see any real crypto in your own hands.\\n\\nThis is mainly an on-ramp for institutions anyway.ETC is such a joke! Maybe after ETH mining is ending, miners will try to revoke it from the dead! ;-)What are ghost chains?An etf can have a redemption mechanism to turn shares directly into BCH. It keeps the market properly balanced.interesting and also scary. I would only feel safe if the redemption is on-chain immediately otherwise there\\'s room for synthetic bullshit. Gonna go read up some aussie / euro etf documents and see how they handle it.Not more scary then coinbase, Grayscale uses coinbase custody to store all their coins.I see [coinflex](https://coinflex.com/home) get mentioned here often.

YuuhuuuuuuuWaiting for that large BOOM that will enlighten and shock the whole Crypto Market.Yess can\\'t wait for that anymore, thinking about the same thing, lol I\\'m being very impatient!I think we all get developed while being in this sub page, indeed it feels so good here!Thank you, sir! For making Bitcoin usable for ordinary people with Bitcoin.com wallet.Inb4 daddy Roger keeps the lights on at jessquit apartment \\n ü§°I used to think you were a troll but I no longer think that\\'s the case FWIW.The advanced level top of the pyramid trolling. You are not supposed to know about that.HeheLOL I just noticed after your comment, it\\'s sooo hilarious xDDDCan you explain? I think you might just be seeing things that aren\\'t there. R/Bitcoin is a much better place for delusional people ;)I use the wallet to tip all the time :)\\n\\nu/chaintipmiddle school is hard but you\\'ll get through itroger is coolThanks. It\\'s worth something.What?Chivo ü§°Life\\'s getting hard niggas be still stuck on schools. Feels sadthank you for giving me the opportunity to downvote you!Clown wallet haha fake custodial good point> Chivo\\n\\nIt\\'s not a replacement for educationOk dictatorHuh??Reported for spamming one wordsü§°Reported...BTC‚Äôer crying for authority üòÇWhat?Cry babies of BTC like whenever I say them about BCH they trolled me. Me enjoying carry on!Hard?\\n\\nPaging u/jessquit this user is posting unrelated comment copy paste everywhereLmao keep begging for authority bro thats very BTC of you. Now I understand why you like little dictators like  in bukele in el salvador lmaoPlease do not unnecessarily ping mods.  Harassing the mods is a violation of Rule 5.  This is your third warning.  Use the downvote function for comments that you do not feel add value.  Thank you.Huh?Are you saying spamming unrelated comments does not break the rules?\\n\\nSweet I could go nuts with that policy?It\\'s quite clear that you are already going nuts with that policy.\\n\\nOur sub is, by intention, a censorship-free / low-moderation sub.  You have been operating for some time now as an obvious community disruptor, the sort of behavior that would get you insta-banned from rbitcoin, rcryptocurrency, and most other reddit subs for that matter.\\n\\nHowever, the sub\\'s owner, a man named Roger Ver, apparently believes so strongly in your right to free speech, that he would rather you hang out in this sub shitposting all damn day, including making ad hominem attacks on his character, than to see your right to free speech infringed.\\n\\nHowever, repeatedly spamming the same text over and over is in fact a violation of Rule 5.  I have warned both you and /u/BitcoinCashRules to please CUT THIS SHIT OUT and try to act like adults.  If you cannot behave with even a minimum of consideration for the UNBELIEVABLY TOLERANT RULES then your account might be placed in timeout or banned altogether.\\n\\nThe primary reason that we do not do this, is because we understand that it is exactly what you want, so that then you can go around calling the mods of this sub \"hypocrites\" and whining all day in other subs.\\n\\nI feel honestly sorry for you.  I can\\'t imagine having such a useless, boring life that the most entertaining thing I could think up to do would be to spend day after day harassing other people.  I would suggest counseling for your issues.  Have a nice day.I am just having a conversation with you. This is a forum, please explain.üëçWhat?Huh?I hope that this clears things up for you.\\n\\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qbbgfb/about_rule_5/What is the problem?So off topic text is spam, and you are choosing to be biased in not removing pro bch spammersThis sub considers all forks of Bitcoin to be on-topic.  This is explained in the FAQ stickied to the top of the sub.\\n\\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/js6jft/frequently_asked_questions_and_information_thread/Off topic spam isn\\'t related to any fork?what\\n\\nedit: yes, off-topic spam is not related to any forkü§° that\\'s my hall pass right hereI don\\'t understand youIt appears that you, unsurprisingly, did not read the post I made *specifically for you* to clarify Rule 5 violations.\\n\\nTherefore I will repeat the relevant text here.  I will make sure that you cannot miss the important part:\\n\\n___\\n\\nRule #5 does not necessarily consider repetitious low-effort comments to be spam, assuming they do not link anywhere or contain the same off-topic text. **For example, repeatedly replying IN THE SAME THREAD by posting a clown face, asking \"what?\", saying \"no\" over and over again, is not necessarily considered \"spam\" according to our current rules**, in particular because of the difficulty making determinations of what is \"spam\" and what is simply an annoyed or confused user, or a caustic debate. Annoyed, confused, low-effort, or harsh debate is tolerated on this sub.\\n\\nThe solution to these low-effort comments is the downvote button. The purpose of the downvote button is to signal a comment that does not add value, or which detracts from the value of the conversation in the sub.\\n\\nThat said, Rule #5 does prohibit excess duplication of comments. **An example might be a user who posts the same comment over and over THROUGHOUT THE SUB.**\\n\\nAs always, a degree of subjectivity is required to determine whether or not these comments violate Rule 5. When deciding if a violation has taken place, **we will consider whether the repeated comments are thoughtful and informative, or low-effort and off-topic.** Some users have some boilerplate replies to common questions that they copy-paste because it\\'s pointless having to type out the same complex reply over and over. As long as the repeated comments are on topic, information-rich, and not excessively repeated, they are welcome. **If the comments are off-topic or low-effort, and excessively repeated, then a Rule 5 violation has taken place.**\\n\\n___\\n\\nYou have been warned.Central banks were a vehicle to remove monetary policy from the hands of war mongering sovereigns.\\n\\nCryptocurrencies are a vehicle to remove monetary policy from the hands of war mongering oligarchs.BTC is the best way to acquire fiat.\\n\\nBCH is the best way to acquire crypto.Bitcoin is terribly unfit for replacing fiat currencies because it can\\'t be used to steal citizens\\' purchasing power through inflation.ü§¶\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶\\u200d‚ôÇÔ∏è\\n\\nI back neither, but these points are presented like a grade school debater.No one is sending me BTC tips, so I disagree. My time in this sub is the only time I\\'ve seen crypto used the way money is used in real life.You are right.\\n\\nBitcoin Cash can be used as cash, i.e. currency. It might replace many other currency in the future.In what world do u think the 1% Will allow themselves to lose??? They control the power. Literal wars are fight costing the 99% to lose their lives left and right to maintain that power.\\n\\nThere will be a central bank digital currency whether we like it or not and bitcoin core will simply be the alternative and act as the perfect store of wealth and also useful as an alternate to cash.I hope that one day this will happen with many crypto assets not only with Bitcoin.True, this is what cryptocurrencies been doing, they are removing monetary policyIndeed, BTC and BCH are doing so great these days, I never regret investing in these two.So you get BCH tips? Wow that\\'s niceDoubt it.  Too many other coinsHow can we use BCH?Go ahead punk, put all your fiat money and bet on the 1%. Stockholm syndrom much? Here is your chance to change the odds in your favor and you chicken out. Powk powk powk powk.\\n\\nTheir money only has value when we believe it does, if we collectively stop believing their money has value then they lose all their power. You think policy and military are going to fight for them when they get paid in completely worthless fiat? Think again.ReportedReportedBCH tips are good to have.it motivate many to post good content.Like cashI would also love some bch tipsNo I mean like places where it is acceptedNo I mean like places where it is acceptedhttps://map.bitcoin.comInteresting!What is this man ? Can you explain a little bit ?I am interested.Will it provides smart contract source code ?Looks good.Are you familiar with decentralized exchanges like Uniswap?ReportedI bought it. These are my 5 am buying decisions. Im going to sleep now.What is LawPunks? 6 BCH?My last good desktop was build in 2009 and destroyed by the TSA in 2013. Have not had a gaming PC since 2013. Will be nice to stream my music from something descent again and play warthunder in the highest settings without my laptop overheating.  Also virgoCX is amazing. From selling the punk to CAD on my bank account in 5 minutes. \\n\\n\\nGod I love BCH.\\n\\nBy the way, this is the first nice thing (that I don\\'t really need) I am going to buy for myself with crypto gains since 2017.Cool. How much did you spend?Enjoy!We are still searching for justin sun guys...#3 is yet to be minted. Everyone is going crazy looking for itAny market places like opensea.io can help the trading of NFT on smartBCH ?Half-Life Alyx is more than worth the investment you\\'re about to make! \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nCongratulations and wishing you a less stressful experience with Jeff, than I had üòÖWow. Congratz!WWGFDHonestly, why are people paying so much for these things?  Is it purely money laundering?  Is it greater fool theory?  I can‚Äôt imagine this being worth more than a few thousand sats once the NFT hype wears off.Look into Oculus Quest 2 - better then then index in many ways imhoDamn bruh good for you, hope you enjoy and do what you wanna do with that!Wow....just when i started to lose hope with my coin investments.... this is amazing guys im speechless just look before its to late here a screenshot from twitter https://ibb.co/TcjP4pYI nothing to ask but one question, which is where did you get the courage ot sell?NFTs are a money laundering scheme and there is nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.Seriouly you just sell your all of the bch for a computer.If you are the one here, then congrats buddy, you go the sleep.How did it feel for you to read this post? Did you feel worse about your buying decision after reading it? I was thinking before I saw your comment that OP is kind of a weird flex in that the buyer of an NFT might not appreciate seeing the seller come here to crow about his mad gainz, and now here you are, so I have to ask.Lawpunks, I thought it to be the name of a person, btw what is it>? a clone of cryptopunk with some modifications to it. (Every new EVM compatible chain within months usually ends up with 50 so cryptopunk clones.) \\n\\nRuns on smartBCH. https://blockng.money/#/beam\\n\\nThere is still 3500 punks to be minted. And it\\'s very addictive. It\\'s 0.01 BCH per punk and right now everybody is minting punks to try to get the last special, JustinFuckingSun. \\n\\nThere were 4 specials and Cizi was one of them.  I think the specials will all sell between 5 - 10 BCH.This is really glad to hear that bch is becoming something for the dreams.I got in early by  providing some LP for law, the token of lawpunks, and early APY was high so some of the gains there were used to get free punks with.\\n\\nI think in total I spend some 1.5 BCH to get about 250 some punks. I found Cizi after getting about a 120 punks.Anyhow, doesn\\'t matter how much he spend, the thing matters is he sell all.thx!I think I was sleeping the matter, what happens with the justin?Play with AlyxWhat is this, are you trying to make the game in this matter?How does a comment like this get downvoted ? What the fuck is wrong with you peoplewhy do people buy shitcoins? The answer is speculation. Always speculation. They all believe that eventually somebody richer then them will come along and buy it for more.Same brad here dude, but you need o polish you mind a bit.He is speculating it might sell for 100x one day. Afterall smart bch is one of the best EVMs.I feel like i got a good deal. Plus kain is a friend and has helped me alot personally. He also helps the bch community in so many ways. kain is a big reason why i have so much gains on smartbch so no matter what, im happy with the purchase and wish kain the best. He deserves itHow do you mint them? Staking? What\\'s the minting, e.g. distribution algorithm? Is it randomly awarded the LawPunks?Some people also like collecting things. Think trading cards that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars due to rarity/misprint/condition. Same idea. At least with these NFTs you dont have to worry about them getting creased or burnt in a fire. The only novel risk when compared to physical collectibles is leaking/losing your private keys.Good point I guess. Why do you find smartBCH to be one of the best?Thanks for answering. It sounded at first like you had some regrets.And here you got is all at once in a pretty nice way, actually it deserve simply.How are people making \"gains on smartbch?\" Do I need to be in a secret telegram group that announces all this stuff early?You mint them buy buying them for 0.01 BCH per punk.\\n\\nThe minting as far as I know is random, but I have not verified it or looked in to it. I assume the crytopunk code on ETH has been thoroughly vetted and that this code is just a clode of that code.Yeah that is true as well.https://t.me/smartbch_community\\n\\nhttps://t.me/smartbch_token_exchangeOk. Thanks. That was very helpful. Do you need to download the whole Blockchain to be able to code smart contracts? It\\'s smart contract the minting, isn\\'t it?So I can pay 0.01bch and get an NFT worth 6BCH? I\\'ve never used NFTs before but I\\'d like to make some of that moneyThanks! I\\'ve always wished there was a general Bitcoin Cash discord or telegram thoughYou can code contracts offline, but when actually deploying you will need to point to a node whether yours or someone else\\'s, same as doing a transaction.\\n\\nWhen you mint you\\'re telling a smart contract to run through it\\'s code, and in nft-minting cases it randomly generates the nft.No, I got extremely lucky that after minting just 120 nft\\'s (out of 10 000) I got one of 4 specials. Perhaps before the end of the year a 0.01 BCH lawpunk nft might trade for 0.02 BCH.  This was only the first big sale, but for law punks to become a long term success smartBCH will have to keep attracting people from all over the space.https://t.me/bchchannelCompletely dodgy is tether. But let\\'s be honest, do we really care if a stablecoin is backed by nothing or by USD, which in turn is backed by nothing...ü§∑Can someone explain to me how every single exchange adopted USDT? They\\'ve made it possible to use unvetted USDT to buy crypto and that\\'s frankly insane.It\\'s always felt very wildcat bank to me but Everyone knows this already lmao.That Tether is terrifying is not new. What is new are the piles of evidence mounting that the brewing storm is more Starbucks-sized than your neighbourhood coffee shop.The world will be a better place if that is a thermonuclear grenade and it goes off sooner rather than later.If you owe the bank a million dollars they own you, if you owe them 100 billion dollars you own them?I\\'ll give it a shot. If you run an exchange and the banks won\\'t deal with you then you can\\'t give people an exit ramp into fiat so popular stablecoins become very hard to say \\'No\\' to. Even if you can offer fiat, the fact that all the other exchanges support the stablecoins means you have to also, to convert their customers and stay competitive.Unvetted usdt? it was audited and recent case with CFTC proved that Tether is worth using. It\\'s the first stablecoin which is using by almost all exchanges and which provides opportunity for unbanked people.The fact that we have trolls around just demonstrates to outsiders how uncensored r/btc is. That\\'s a good thing. Ironically, trolls help demonstrate this by providing evidence of no censorship in r/btc .\\n\\nThe downvote button is there for a reason. Here in r/btc , mods almost never use the ban button. In the long run that creates more work for mods, but also in the long run free speech will triumph over censorship. Consider the thesis of [Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970) by Albert Hirschman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty).\\n\\nAlso consider how medieval-era imperial China [essentially banned ocean exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haijin) and how [innovators in small-state Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_spread_of_the_printing_press#Switzerland) were able to [escape bans and censorship](https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/53544/did-the-ottoman-empire-suppress-the-printing-press) via voting with their feet, e.g. [the spread of the printing press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_spread_of_the_printing_press). We all know how [that particular historical era played out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Divergence) \\\\-- China was eventually subjugated by European powers. I hope r/btc would be more kind, of course, if and when a reckoning occurs ;)u/chaintipThis seems very fair and well written.\\nI admire your dedication to the subs ethos of free speech.\\nI\\'m especially happy to read this\\n\\n>\\n Annoyed, confused, low-effort, or harsh debate is tolerated on this sub.\\nThe solution to these low-effort comments is the downvote button.\\n\\nIt\\'s how we prevent this sub from devolving into an echo chamberAs this post has replaced the faq sticky, could we please replace the ‚Äûwho‚Äòs the competition‚Äú sticky with the faq? Thanks.Fair enough! well appreciated with the rule and would be helpful enough for the users!The facts are late to move into my mind right now, and I am gonna reverse them at onece.Good enough for Reddit. I don\\'t see how r/btc won\\'t be banned in the long-term for bad reasons, Memo protocol and alike are the future of free speech and user-side filters are the future of steering the Feed\\n\\nMost popular example for now is highly recommended uBlock OriginWhat about reddit spam definition of excessive posts or comments in a community?  Some of these troll accounts far exceed that definition trolling nearly every post especially the one that I\\'m sure triggered this post.Sounds mostly fair and not open to much overreach, except... what do you mean by \\'on topic\\'? Do you mean on topic for the sub in general, or on topic for the comment or question being replied to? Like if someone keeps asking off-topic questions or making off-topic assertions or accusations, the person repeatedly supplying a link that addresses the issue or sets them straight should probably not be warned or punished. Wouldn\\'t want to bar anyone from defending themselves against such stuff.Well this is really helpful today, because this teaches me something new.Can\\'t you guys ban them before they make 100 comments ? You can still guess even if they spam 10 same comments.Extremely insightful thank you.I was wondering about the the summary to make it into the mind and here you go, thanks man.Thanks for clearing all our doubts briefly.cheers to that.***\\nu/jessquit, you\\'ve [been sent](https://www.blockchain.com/bch/address/bitcoincash:qrelay23r5sd65e4xqlnccp787v3k0wgcqrzd832kl) `0.00082377 BCH` | `~0.50 USD` by u/redditornym\\nvia [chaintip](http://www.chaintip.org).\\n***What actually I have to do to have a successful tip, I need it.That should be removed I guess in my point of view.Yeah this would be nice to to make it some changes here for sure.Users are always here to have some new story here but mostly it bores here.Bad botOnly if steering the feed will help to make some thing helpful here.We try to be more tolerant than the reddit default definition.What are these accounts are actually onto with all of their stuff?If this will happen, how will Reddit earn bro that\\'s a real question?No one even Facebook or Insta still didn\\'t have a find a way to differentiate which one is real or fake.> Do you mean on topic for the sub in general\\n\\nyes\\n\\n> or on topic for the comment or question being replied to\\n\\ncould be\\n\\n> Like if someone keeps asking off-topic questions or making off-topic assertions or accusations, the person repeatedly supplying a link that addresses the issue or sets them straight should probably not be warned or punished.\\n\\nagreed 100%, this is not the point\\n\\nhere is an example of an off-topic reply that has been already posted twice in this very thread:\\n\\n> I recommend [name redacted] whom just helped me recover my Btc wallet,he also help in recovery of gmails,iclouds,Facebook and others pm him directly through this link [link redacted]\\n\\nthis is technically on-topic for this sub, but completely off-topic for this thread, and was posted multiple times -- the person is a spammer.  the comments were removed by the automod because the link [which I redacted] triggered the anti-spam rules.  We wouldn\\'t bother to issue a warning if this only happened twice and the comments were already caught anyway by automod, but if the person did it, say, a dozen times, then they need a warning.  If they keep doing it, more warnings.  Eventually a timeout.\\n\\nThis is *exceptionally* lenient -- most would argue, too lenient.  It\\'s definitely a lot more work for us, as opposed to simply banning the user after the first *obviously spam* comment, which is what most subs would do (ie. rbitcoin)>Can\\'t you guys ban them before they make 100 comments ?\\n\\nNot if they\\'re automated, please reread the relevant paragraph\\n\\n> You can still guess even if they spam 10 same comments.\\n\\nIn this sub we would only ban someone based on subjective evidence if the subjective evidence was monumentally overwhelming. It\\'s part of the mission of this sub to be minimally moderated.I also agree.\\n\\n/u/ShadowOfHarbringer put the video back, i don\\'t know, maybe he\\'s got some good reasons for that. I\\'ll leave it for him to decide.Totally agreed with my point of view here in my mindset.Exactly they check patience and tolerance whereas few ain\\'t and comes with some lame comments.Banning would tend out to be an absolute solution for this.Well OK. Good case! As long as it isn\\'t used to enable any Kafkatrapping (defined as a system in which people or their websites can be smeared and then when they try to provide externally linked exculpatory evidence or reasoning to clear their names, that itself can be considered proof of guilt and a bannable/deletable offence).\\n\\nIf Kafkatrapping remains definitely off the table, then I don\\'t see a problem with your interpretation of the rules.I put the video back because I feel that nowadays people do not really care much for history (or reason, for that matter).\\n\\nIf people cared about history and what this sub represents and how Crypto-As-Cash fans were mistreated, cheated, manipulated and hurt, then BTC would be now worth $600, and BCH would be worth $60000.\\n\\nThe sad truth is, nobody cares. So I assumed that having a message (in the video) that tells the truth about current fucked up order of things in the world and that BCH can fix that is actually more valuable in this situation.\\n\\nI will of course put FAQ back in few days or so.\\n\\n-----------------\\n\\nDo you really prefer the FAQ, /u/taipalag ?\\n\\nPlease tell me why do you care. I want to understand the reasons.But before banning we needed some more information regarding it.But who will differentiate which one is spam and which one is real?> Please tell me why do you care. I want to understand the reasons.\\n\\nThere‚Äôs rather a lot of ‚Äústuff‚Äù crammed into that video. BCH vs. centrally controlled fiat currency makes sense. BCH vs. covid vaccines‚Ä¶ kind of a weird and controversial take.It‚Äòs OK for me if you put the FAQ back in a few days.Now I get someone who is not talking shit and with real facts.Sure, no problem.Yes,please put the FAQ back up. Is two (2) the limit for stickied posts?> Yes,please put the FAQ back up. Is two (2) the limit for stickied posts?\\n\\n2 is the limit indeed.That is a ridiculously small amount of posts that can be stickied.This is actually standard, reddit-wide.It\\'s a crappy rule.Whooops, sorry, I thought I am replying to something else.\\n\\nDeleted my other reply.This is news I love to hear.\\n\\nDEXes FTW !!!Wow ,its a great news to hear.thanks for sharing here.Nicely done!Does this mean one can use Komodo to swap other cryptos for sBCH?  If that\\'s true then there is now a decentralized onboarding process for smartBCH!   \\n That\\'s big news!!nice!Not only Komodo, any asset supported on AtomicDEX, including BCH.That\\'s what I mean.  That\\'s awesome!  I\\'ll try it out this week.You have to wait until the code is merged in the next release.üí™üí™Nice work!Awesome.you must have enjoyed the meetup in Bangalore.cheers.It\\'s looks great and wonderful.your team did a great job.It looks like u/Zunnurayni and I cross-posted this to r/btc within a few minutes of each other. I will reproduce my comments from [the other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qaqj8j/bch_nigeria_appears_to_be_delivering_on_some/):\\n\\n>In [a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/q9x51q/its_been_a_month_since_bch_nigerias_flipstarter/), there were questions raised about whether the proposers of the BCH NG Flipstarter had, in effect, exit scammed. I have no special knowledge of the situation, but it appears that verifiable work is being done, as the photos above show.  \\n>  \\n>u/Zunnurayni has not been updating us frequently, which is undesirable. However, I would caution against people bringing out pitchforks, if for no other reason than the fact that there are intercultural issues at play here. That\\'s in addition to the fact that progress in general may move slowly due to government regulations on businesses in Nigeria. For example, Nigeria ranks quite low on global comparisons for ease of doing business due to licensing requirements and the like.  \\n>  \\n>Disclosure: The only connection I have to BCH NG is that I contributed to [their Flipstarter campaign](https://flipbackend.bitcoincash.network/media/screenshots/lets-take-bitcoincash-to-the-next-level-in-nigeria_running_2021-08-11T100953_bl48hH2.png).Thank you for the updates!\\n\\n> Lunch Event will be Hybrid\\n\\nWhat does this mean?A physical event and also a Virtual oneAh, I see, that is great!\\n\\nKeep up the good workIts obvious why he wants to go with BTC/LN. Dude wants to print BTC.  On Chivo he can credit 10 times the BTC he has locked on LN and no one would know.The best thing blockstream could have done is sell President Bukele on BTC/LN. It just exposes the absolute deceit and incompetence of BTC/LN.\\n\\nHey President Bukele, if you want to join the future electronic cash system for the world, Bitcoin Cash stands ready today. \\n\\nUnlike BTC/LN/Custodial, Bitcoin Cash would save your nation a ton of money implementing it as Bitcoin Cash is ready to go and incredibly efficient.\\n\\nUnlike BTC/LN/Custodial, Bitcoin Cash can not be abused through money printing.\\n\\nUnlike BTC/LN/Custodial, Bitcoin Cash will allow the [22% of the El Salvador living on less than $5.50/day](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/SLV/el-salvador/poverty-rate) to be banked and participate not just in the local economy, but the global economy too.Genuine question (especially if you\\'re one of the protestors): what is the complaint against Bitcoin? I don\\'t understand how this can be wrapped into the issue of authoritarianism, given that it explicitly *removes* monetary policy from government. Anyone?\"Thousands take the street after selling their $BTC and watching it go up after\".Here‚Äôs the overhead view of your big bad protest:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/22eduard0/status/1449849521178021899?s=21\\n\\nHa. CIA and IMF co-funding this one for sure. Check out the interviews with marchers. Paid and fed to be there. Hilarious.Yes because the people like to live on the Shit and not to progress, the lack of self criteria make those idiots March against this great President. Shame on you SalvadorüëÜüëÜüëÜ\\n\\nHe is going to create his own currency.That\\'s not how it works...This is most likely what they did. Bought 3 million worth of Bitcoin, pretend they bought 30 million.\\n\\nAnd I am sure in the future Tether is willing to loan them Tether if they had over that last 3 million as collateral.He doesn\\'t want a true cash system, just a system he can control.> Hey President Bukele, if you want to join the future electronic cash system for the world, Bitcoin Cash stands ready today.\\n\\nSo for you it is not a matter of principle, it\\'s just that BCH was not elected as a currency. The hypocrisy...How do we reconcile our concerns with the fact that bitcoin has taken supreme dominance.Bitcoin Cash is indeed ready to go, were the head guy to decide on BCH.\\n\\nA blocksize of 128MB would allow for every resident of El Salvador to make 10 bitcoin cash transactions a day.  Existing bitcoin cash software has already been shown to work at this block size.>CIA and IMF co-funding this one for sure. \\n\\nMy thoughts exactly. Bukele has enormous popular support so it\\'s going to be a hard fight for them to get him out. More likely they just send in a helicopter and extract him. But 100% they must take him out, he has stuck his finger in the eye of the global financiers.This protest was bought to you courtesy of the CENTRAL BANK, have a nice day citizen, and remember, do not defy us.You obviously got no clue how custodial solutions on LN works.Bukele does not appear to get control either.\\n\\nI take comfort in the fact the people of El Salvador are now aware of cryptocurrency and they don\\'t need anyone\\'s permission to adopt Bitcoin Cash.\\n\\nPeople adopting Bitcoin Cash is how a nation should eventually make Bitcoin Cash legal tender. Just look at Bitcoin Cash adoption in Venezuela or Argentina. For them, Bitcoin Cash is the path to economic freedom.>So for you it is not a matter of principle, it\\'s just that BCH was not elected as a currency. The hypocrisy...\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you drew that conclusion. BCH aligns with principles of free choice (no gov\\'t sponsored wallet required) and people\\'s money (no controlled development team or custodial 2nd/3rd layers).There are crypto haters in every community. The misinformed are everywhere. ü§∑They do that and Bitcoin adoption will explode suddenly. Handwriting on the wall.Remember,  citizen, we own you.

I\\'m not sure we can lean on that as an explanation for current price movements.nah, 1:100 is no bottom, we need to hit 1:1000 firstThe fact that because of the fork people got BCH for free hurt the ratio a lot. It gave maxis a free tool to manipulate the BCH price by dumping their BCH. Whales who decided to keep their BCH most likely didn\\'t go out of their way to buy even more BCH, making it even easier to tank the market.>Looks like the BCH/BTC ratio may have finally bottomed out. It may be that either Bitcoin holders are out of BCH to swap into BTC, or they think BTC is overvalued and is being dumped on 70 year old retail grandpas at the top, using the new futures ETF.\\n\\nThe volume at this time and at this price range is minor compared to volume in August & September. If this was a trend reversal, I would expect to see significant volume.\\n\\nThe source for most trades happening on BCH/BTC are not necessarily just an individual trader\\'s direct exchange between BCH & BTC. Most liquidity is from arbitrage bots chasing profit from the differences in individual coin spot prices.Without BTC, BCH is nothing. It is like CNN without TRUMPOr you are Chinese and trying to influence the MarketPresently yes.  I think this proposition underestimates the importance of BCH (aka the original vision of crypto replacing the legacy economy). \\n\\nI have a feeling that the only reason tether is still allowed to operate is that when it does fail there will be another round with bch. I‚Äôm all but sure there is another plan being formed to marginalize bch and when it‚Äôs hatched tether will rug pull and new battles will be fought.BCH hashrate bottomed out at 1Eh on Wednesday, now it\\'s back up to 1.7Eh. BTC seems to be dumping (selling the news on BITO), so BCH may have more upside.If they run out of BCH to swap into BTC or they stop shorting BCH , at least the ratio can stop tracking it.They may just sell BTC because it has reached a high, and then wait for you to buy at a low.the institutionals still did not get they are only buying US$ counterfeits from a shady cartelHow do these work? These are just sidebets?\\n\\nPeople pool money in a fund, some gamble that price is going to go down and some gamble that price is going to go up and the winners  pay the losers?\\n\\nIs there not a huge risk that Tether puts funds in these and then just either prints the price up or dumps the price down?\\n\\nHow can you have a side bet on a regulated system when the underlying assets is almost completely open to manipulation because for every 2 real dollars of trading volume there is 7 or 8 against Tether?I keep it in cold storage ;)Move your BCH to smartBCH where you can stake it or yield farm on BCH/flexUSD. \\n\\nThis is also protest against volatility. Use a impermanent loss calculator to see how much less capital you lose when the market goes down. If the market goes up you still gain, just not as much. \\n\\nAnd as a bonus, you get interest on the flexUSD. \\n\\nHowever to enter such a pool you have to sell half of your BCH for flexUSD. But don\\'t worry, that BCH will only be bought by people that care about BCH.This will take some timeWhales don\\'t need the help of forked coins to manipulate another coin\\'s price.In the fork, BCH holders also got BTC for free, and could dump that at an advantageous ratio.Doesnt need to be high volume if the market hasnt realized that the sellers have run out of BCH to dump.

That would mean it would have taken them ~60,000 days to get their money off and couldn‚Äôt be done in one tx. So obviously the stricter kyc isn‚Äôt the cause behind this withdrawal.It\\'s more like 600 million as Tether is not backed.TBF I would do exactly the same, who knows his actual reason? I wouldn\\'t even be comfortable with that much not in my control.. now they say \"it may be a pain in the ass to get your money out\".\\n\\n\"This guy has 6 million, lets harass him with KYC hoping he can\\'t provide proof\".\\n\\nWhere would that money go if somebody failed KYC?\\n\\nSeems like a good way to try and legally rob people.When one person has 6.3 Billion , you know they are using it to win futures bets on Bitcoin prices. \\n\\nThe only way to eventually stop the system from being rigged is to buy their crypto when they place a downward bet and then short squeeze them, the thing is , even if they lose such a bet on BCH , they will just say their upward bets on Bitcoin were more gains than their losses.Why would anyone leave $6 billion on an exchange?If even on Binance they can\\'t fraud it\\'s becoming a harsh world :(they need space to fit all the $UST they\\'re about to mint üß†.based, only dumbs doesnt know And People left, money came. üò¨I think these two events in Tether are not connected in any way>obviously the stricter kyc isn‚Äôt the cause behind this withdrawal.\\n\\nAlso one would expect that someone with $6 billion could afford a few fake identities for KYC :)\\n\\nThen again exchanges be robbing people all of the time under the guise of their KYC policy.But for that sum of money they must have KYC .Isn\\'t it ?Manipulating the whale with $6 GODDAMN BILLION Tether.Ha ha yes this.

What kind of BCH adoption is needed for 6.3$ billion of capital from people to come buy spot BCH? How many people transitioning from fiat to BCH is needed? I think barring a fast economic collapse,it would take so long that there wouldn\\'t be any \"short squeeze\" at all. I think we won\\'t see the price suppression end until the tether mafia is in jail and their whole mechanism dismantled...So this means that without KYC I am not able to withdraw anymore? Nice :DYou can easily manipulate the market with that amount of money (make the price go up and down and take advantage of market movements afterwards). With that kind of money, I\\'m sure they\\'re not afraid of binance taking their money as they have the power to go after them and take it back. Either that or binance is complicit with their market making. Institutions regularly use large amounts of capital for market making (market manipulation) to make money off of retail traders (speculators, gamblers), it\\'s just the way it is.Wow, I miss read it.\\n\\nSurely people would get targeted like that, it\\'s obvious anybody with money can start an exchange, and there are certainly people involved in some with criminal backgrounds.\\n\\nI don\\'t trust any of them TBH.True.I dont think there is 6.3 b worth of money involved with BCH as that is over 10 million BCH.\\n\\nI meant over time these big whales who can currently move the markets wherever they want, will get bought out by a lot of small guys, at least I hope that happens.\\n\\nUnlike Bitcoin, where investors can currently only buy fractions of Bitcoins, investors in BCH can still buy plenty of full coins, which can help spread the supply among many new investors. This kind of user base will continue as long as BCH stays this low. The more early adopters, the better, as it can help form a userbase who have a mindset focused on the utility of crypto, including spend and replace.[Cryptocurrency Tether is fined $41 million for lying about reserves](https://fortune.com/2021/10/15/tether-crypto-stablecoin-fined-reserves/)\\n\\n>For years, Tether told customers and the broader cryptocurrency market that it had $1 in reserve to back every token, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in a Friday\\xa0statement. That claim was wildly misleading, according to the agency. For instance, from June to September 2017, there was never more than $61.5 million backing Tether, even as more 442 million coins were circulating at one point.\\n\\n>‚ÄúThis case highlights the expectation of honesty and transparency in the rapidly growing and developing digital assets marketplace,‚Äù said acting CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam.\\n\\n>Tether failed to disclose that it held unsecured receivables and non-fiat assets as part of its reserves, and falsely told investors it would undergo routine, professional audits to demonstrate that it maintained ‚Äú100% reserves at all times.‚Äù In fact, Tether reserves weren‚Äôt audited, the agency said. Until at least 2018, Tether manually kept tabs on its reserve levels, a process that wasn‚Äôt updated in real time, the CFTC said. Tether didn‚Äôt admit or deny the CFTC‚Äôs allegations.\\n\\n>Treasury officials are preparing to release a report on stablecoins, and officials are also discussing whether to launch a formal review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council into whether the tokens pose a systemic economic threat. Tether is a key\\xa0focus\\xa0of the government scrutiny, people familiar with the matter have said.\\xa0\\n\\n[Tether is being fined for lying during its early days up to 2019. 95% of the $USDT supply was printed after that, nobody has even investigated that period yet.](https://twitter.com/muellerberndt/status/1449680632288710665?s=20)They consulted with Adam Back on how to scale.[Image](https://youtube.com/watch?v=SVy0HnJeOJE&feature=share) credit.> Tether manually kept tabs\\n\\nYeah, no biggie.

On both sides there are entities that have to be trusted to keep the \"treasure\" (bch locked on either side). \\n\\nI would feel much more comfortable using for example komodos atomicdex for trustless swapping between stable coin and bch (this will be possible once they roll out slp support) or anyhedge contracts for going long bch or hedging bch vs. usd, gold, whatever. \\n\\nBoth solutions require me to wait. I know general protocols has something cool in the pipeline (\"bch bull\") and the sha bridge is being worked on... just letting people know the reason at least one guy isn\\'t jumping right in.üëçüëçGood points.Is transferring BCH to sBCH considered a taxable event in the USA?Most exchanges offer shorting on STABLECOIN or CASH-SETTLED futures.

If we go towards 100K BTC then ETH and BSC will have fees that will drive many projecst towards smartBCH. Even avax will see 50 cents per tx base fees.no, you swap 1 to 1, no gains or losses possible.Wouldn\\'t 5k bch get us to about 10-20 cent fees too?It\\'s not that simple. You would have to argue it\\'s the same asset and you\\'re not swapping anything, just moving across infrastructure (which could price hard). If it isn\\'t the same asset (likely imo), you\\'re swapping 2 assets which is taxed like selling the one and buying the other.From what I understand by swapping I would have to pay capital gains on the increased value of my BCH at that point. Same as if I bought ETH with my BCH.As I understand it BCH doesn\\'t swap with smartBCH in the way your describing, move BCH is a better term. If you move BCH from one of your personal wallets to another, still in your custody, then you haven\\'t sold any or created a taxable event.

Seems there is a lot of potential for Bitcoin Cash but BCH has yet to be become the darling of mainstream investors. The new exchange traded product should surely give BCH a boost. There is a reason Bitcoin Cash address growth out-performed BTC by a factor of 6, merchant adoption and commerce. Such solid economic activity will indeed see Bitcoin Cash inevitably overtake all other cryptos. I am just not seeing other cryptos with this kind of base momentum.Institutions are still pumping the crypto \"myspace\" (Legacy tech Bitcoin) while the upgrade (BCH) already exists right in front of them.Gonna be the black sheep here but I don\\'t like youtubers pumping BCH like this, it reminds me of bitcoin maximalist / tether maximalist behavior.\\n\\nEducating people about its usage and its integrity is far more practical and ethical than telling them \"its price will bump so buy it\" mind you -\\n\\nBCH price will definitely bump, but even if so.

Those people are going to show up. And that will be a good thing as long as we stay true and not let them take over.Inevstment will make it more powerful as no one was before.Yeah it does make sense, Institutions are really behaving way dumb or way smart and selfishPeople who treat crypto-currencies as stocks are bad for the space in general, but either we like it or not that\\'s the majority for now.\\n\\n**Even the people who claim BCH is a shitcoin.**\\n\\nThat\\'s fine, when they do we will tell them that bitcoin was the actual shitcoin all along.True this is the real issue, these people are just behaving very immatureYeah indeed it\\'s the goal of p2p2 decentralized currency for the world.More known\\\\*.My only worry is the last remaining usable coins will get hijacked and derailed when all these people finally turn up. Also the average IQ of the sub will dramatically drop, we will have to keep reminding ourselves that it\\'s more than likely we are talking to an absolute idiot. I kinda like it how it is now and am worried about the affect of an \"investor\" flood.\\n\\nI worry that XMR will be the only one left standing as \"investors\" are scared of it.\\n\\nAs long as this sub keeps it real.. LTC is already going in a direction I don\\'t like and is infested with these investor types, at least on the Reddit community anyway.\\n\\nMaybe I\\'m being overly pessimistic, but the masses always bring trouble.\\n\\nBulls in a China shop.BUt their will sonner a time when majority will be us and they will be minors.This sub will continue keeping it real cause it\\'s full of idealistic people who hope about satoshi\\'s dream, and battle tested veterans that come from way back to the creation of BCH its self. So no that\\'s not a problem.\\n\\nWe exposed their pumps and vote manipulation attempts many times here already.\\n\\nThe masses will be difficult to handle no doubt, XMR will always be standing cause it was created to stand, just like BCH.\\n\\nLet me ask you this, do you consider knowledgeable intelligent people who\\'re aware about economics and cryptocurrencies to be capable of losing to a bunch of \"bch goes up up\" idiots just because of their sheer numbers?\\n\\nI don\\'t.\\n\\nThe investor flood will have to adjust or they will embarrass themselves publicly.The sheer number thing worries me yes, just look at what happened to BTC.\\n\\nThe masses were almost used as a weapon.\\n\\nNever underestimate the power of many stupid people.When their will be more crowd their will be more investment and people will earn more from money.Bravo. Send them into the light and they flee like cockroaches.Can you please explain the scam here? I\\'m not exceptionally familiar with btcI\\'ve had maybe 10 people contact me like this.

Building reliable applications and infrastructure is the priority. This is slow, especially because the \\'Bitcoin Cash culture\\' dictates that this work needs to be done voluntarily or through Flipstarter funding.\\n\\nIf growth is your priority, you should check out DASH or AVAX. They are both growing rapidly, and they have funding mechanisms to continue to accelerate the growth. Their growth comes at the cost of decentralization.\\n\\nI build on BCH because decentralization and self-sufficiency are my top priorities.BCH is undoubteably the best adoption/real life use/shopping currency.\\n\\nBut is there any growth in crypto being used in real life use cases?\\n\\nMaybe the problem is that crypto is not being used in real world enough, just for speculation and gambling instead?Take in mind that a good part of BCH activity is going to SmartBCH.Sure, zoom out:\\n\\nhttps://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/activeaddresses-btc-bch.html#alltime\\n\\nIf you look at this chart, especially compared to BTC, you will see BCH starting to produce a similar pattern to BTC in 2013/2014 (and not coincidentally, it is currently in a similar price range).\\n\\nSo as the market has been moving sideways, it hasn\\'t showed huge day to day growth yet, but on a year to year basis it is making progress that will snowball over the next several years.\\n\\nIf you\\'re super worried about it, you have two options.\\n\\n1. Sell out.  Problem solved.  Come back once it\\'s taking off.\\n2. Start helping out with adoption.  Help spread it, use it more in trade yourself, and be part of the solution.Here you go: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/q61d3k/bitcoin_cash_report_by_the_etc_group_notes_new/I believe BTC will get a massive growth just like it happened before we gotta know about Bitcoin lol.It\\'s not apparent to everybody who wins, winning is not the goal. \\n\\nThe growth of Bitcoin has severely been undermined by all the forks, mainly forking off people you don\\'t like.you picked the wrong horse. the growth is in in bitcoin. not bitcoin cash.\\n\\nbitcoin cash is about to flipped by SHIB. an doge coin affinity scamcoin.Awesome! You are waking up. BCH lost the fork of course its flatlined. BCH is sinking and has been since it was introduced. It will never reach its ATH again. Thank you for this post. Sold my BCH Aug of 2020 for bitcoin.  Thank god!!!No. When a bullrun happens people will go back to posting small fruit stands in Nigeria accepting BCH saying adoption is coming again to try to build more hype and pull people in.  BCHs community killed BCH. It\\'s pretty much a GME situation now. Lots of people who bought in and got burned trying to keep hype going to cash out. I do believe BCH will do its runs again, break 1k etc but as for the longterm? Nope. It\\'s not building itself It\\'s own image. I mean posting in the sub titled \"btc\" says enough. It\\'s the jealous younger sibling. Maybe if it made it\\'s own branding and spread that then it could distinguish a name for itself as a standalone crypto, but the community refuses to do that. If BTC did fall, BCH would not be where people turned, they would all feel burned by the entire bitcoin name and go elsewhere. That (bitcoins collapse) would need to happen in order for BCH to be accepted and \"replace\" btc. But due to lack of any of the above, it would just die with it.Sell that shitcoinWorth noting that BCH and gold have been pretty flat while other assets go crazy. Read from that what you will.The comment section is literally filled with spamI feel that the switch from BTC to BCH would rather result you with a progress. Nether sticking on BTC.Litecoin is faking this metric: https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/qbbiq2/litecoin_metrics_are_being_faked_by_one_guy/Look at btc chart when you will see, it‚Äôs exactly the same. Compare with others.Some facts: \\n\\nTotal crypto market cap is 2.5 T which same as in the previous peak.\\n\\nBig winners: prokers, hardware manufacturers, big miners \\n\\nThe process is simple: pump with catalyst end with dump the good part is \"Don\\'t tell us we didn\\'t warn you\" \\n\\nMain purpose of use : easy access to gambling (high futures trading volume and the actual number of btc in supply is significantly small).\\n\\nMost of its finite amount (~19M) exist in few number of addresses which one or more could belong to one person or entity (why they keep holding these amounts, what is their plan) . \\n\\nCould it hit $ 1 M which means market cap of 21M x 1M equal to $ 21 T ( dollars in Circulation ~2T, gold M. Cap $ 11T)\\n\\nAlternative payment system _ ?? Volatility - high transaction fee - no sign of acceptance \"adoption\" - slow - above mentioned and etc.. \\n\\nCan be used or its already been used as collateral what could be level of risk of such a use.\\n\\nBitcoin is a nice story with very weak plot..Invest in DBAThere is no growth. in fact commercial use is shrinking as you can see eg in bitpay stats. however, transaction counts, active addresses etc are blown up by non-monetary use cases: tokens, sidechain peg-ins and outs, memo messages, [noise.cash](https://noise.cash) etc ppDBA TOKEN is now on CMC and coingecko. ..now it selling on pancake swap..very soon it will be list on dafriexchane one of the most exciting exchangesCheck out DBA TokenDamn these kinda answers gives me chills lol, it\\'s true tho, we have to be the growth we want to see.> If you care so much about this number, you should do the same on BCH? It‚Äôs not that hard to do and you could‚Äôve done that instead of making this post.\\n\\nWhat if what they care about is to see the actual genuine number grow, i.e. what they want is genuine crypto adoption, and for it to be the truth? It\\'s weird that you don\\'t even allow for that possibility.that may be true but Litecoin\\'s marketcap went up the same time the active addresses started going up so it\\'s probably not best to quickly write it off as meaningless numbersWow>  the \\'Bitcoin Cash culture\\' dictates that this work needs to be done voluntarily or through Flipstarter funding.\\n\\nNope, you can get some business or VC to fund you. Nobody in BCH will complain as long as what\\'s built isn\\'t destructive to the rest of the ecosystem.\\n\\nThere is no mandate to follow a particular course to generate funding.We have a winner!Yeah I think that\\'s true, crypto should be used like a normal payment method in the whole world, it\\'ll boost the market.Xmr used daily as the default currency for darknet products and services.It\\'s hilarious saying this but, Dogecoin. It\\'s used a lot in the online communitie and probably the most used crypto outside of Defi. Ethereum is probably the most practical and used atm, even with the gas issues. It will become (and already has) a massive hub for decentralized finance. \\n\\nBut as for everyday use in person, no crypto yet. Too speculative still for a lot of business owners to want to accept. I mean companies like Microsoft accept BTC on Xbox for games etc, but that changes randomly.\\n\\nAdoption will come for crypto at a much larger scale, bit it will take more time. We are still in the early phases, so I still see these prices as heavily discounted compared to what we will be seeing in the future.I just expected that there were more people using the coin since 6 months ago> BTC has Lightning but precious few people use it.\\n\\nYou mean other than several million Salvadorans who now have their government\\'s \"Chivo\" LN wallet and who are using it for remittances and for buying Bitcoin?\\n\\nI mean, seriously, you guys should stop lying to yourselves about it.Lightning network is running an entire country!El Salvador has been driving a lot of LN growth. That\\'ll continue to drive it up, I expect.Sources says that not only me others are too are indulged in BCH they seems pretty good enjoying it.>bitcoin cash is about to flipped by SHIB. an doge coin affinity scamcoin.\\n\\nThat tells you all about this market. It is about hype, not fundamentals. BCH is doing fine VS fiat and it actually works. Depending on where you want to go eg financial freedom, control over your money, BCH is the absolute right horse for that.Who gave you gold lolYes, Bitcoin is the real growth, people are running behind Bitcoin cash without knowing the difference between them.As long as we have (probably paid) trolls like you I\\'m pretty sure we are on the right track to financial freedom. Seems we are still a threat.Bitcoin and bitcoin cash are like fish. They sink and rise with the tides. However, the BCH community decided to try to save their fish by pulling it out of the water to prevent it from sinking further. As they watch it flop around gasping for air, passer-bys express concern over what they are doing to that poor fish. They then get angry at the people and say it is a cat and it\\'s fine, it will stand up soon.  As it lays there taking its last breaths, they post on reddit asking why their cat is not getting up.\\n\\nSorry, I\\'m really tired lol> I mean posting in the sub titled \"btc\" says enough.\\n\\n[Please read the FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/js6jft/frequently_asked_questions_and_information_thread/)I agree with some of what you said but Bitcoin Cash cannot be disassociated with Bitcoin because BTC and BCH are two different ideas of the same coin and share the same root.You have a point and i agree with you about people flocking to it when there is a bullrun and forgetting about it when there isn\\'t one. \\n\\nBut about longterm, I think that it can go on, on this life support levels, indefinitely. It\\'s very usable for those of us, that don\\'t chase the big get rich scheme, but just enjoy in having a very own bank in the pocket AND USING it.Paper gold has been pretty flat; it\\'s a highly manipulated market.\\n\\nActual, physical gold has been creeping up, and is getting harder to find.Any sources. That would rather be very helpful. Like I didn\\'t go through it!Indeed true. LOL whatever they wanna speak they just spit it out here and leave.commet removed by reddit filters, manually approved by modsBCH isn‚Äôt going places. Sad truth if it. BTC is what it is because of first mover advantage. It will stay that way because of that. And the story behind Satoshi. \\n\\nEverything BTC Ford can be done better by another coin. Why would people adapt to a coin that is the same as BTC in every way but doesn‚Äôt have the same mythical story and first mover advantage? They won‚Äôt.The fact that the number on BCH would certainly take the larger number.MajorDFT is on of our biggest anti-BCH trolls. We have a few, they come with the goal of sound money. And since we are not censored they can somewhat spread their bullshit if they behave.> so it\\'s probably not best to quickly write it off as meaningless numbers\\n\\nBut they are meaningless numbers, see my dig into it - https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/q94kk9/etc_group_releases_bitcoin_cash_report_praising/hgu9vch/This isn\\'t true, u/BitcoinCashRules is just lying to get you to share his huge losses lol\\n\\nBch is still falling, even doge is outperforming itRight. The point wasn\\'t how developers can and can\\'t be funded. The point is that \\'Bitcoin Cash culture\\' has dictated (through past actions) that funding of \\'common good\\' infrastructure (and thus growth) must be developed voluntarily or through Flipstarter funding. This is as-opposed to coinbase funding like Dash or eCash, or corporate funding such as through Ava Labs for AVAX.\\n\\nThis is a game-theoretical [Snowdrift dilemma](https://wiki.snowdrift.coop/about/snowdrift-dilemma) when it comes to growth and infrastructure in Bitcoin Cash. VCs and businesses won\\'t fund a \\'common good\\' that they can\\'t profit from and their competition can free-ride on, so a lot of things simply don\\'t get done because of the stalemate.\\n\\nThe Bitcoin Cash community has chosen Flipstarter as it\\'s solution to this dilemma.\\n\\nThe original question was about growth. AVAX, Dash, and BCH have chosen very different routes and developed different cultures around funding their growth.That\\'s factsWe never know what kinda things are going to happen in the world, maybe bitcoin gets his value rapidly up like we witnessed before ;)> Ethereum is probably the most practical and used atm\\n\\nLol. Ethereum is literally the least practical and useless coin for it\\'s intended purpose. [People just leave it on exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/q94ju0/unpopular_opinion_i_hate_eth_and_i_hope_it_will/hgu3rog/).\\n\\n[The most adopted coin for non-speculative purpose is Tether](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2019/07/30/millions-in-crypto-is-crossing-the-russia-china-border-daily-there-tether-is-king/)Although dogecoin does function well as p2p cash, the transaction numbers on bitinfo show that it isn\\'t being used as much as BCH.  Same with bitpay.  And from my personal experience, dogecoin doesn\\'t have that same friendly community of sharing and tipping that it used to.  I see BCH, Nano, BTC when people want to tip.  \\n\\nI\\'m curious, where are you seeing actual dogecoin users?  Talking about people that use it, not just speculate.Hype is fast, adoption is slow. What do you expect in 6 Month. How many merchants did you onboard in these 6 month, how many people did you showcase BCH?No, there aren\\'t. 6 months ago was a bull run for bch and then people rushed into it, creating the illusion of adoption. When the bull run ended, those people moved to something else.\\n\\nAbout that line of litecoin, those are all \"fake2 addresses. Some entity/person is creating a mass of fan-in, fan-out transactions, again only to create an illusion of adoption of litecoin.\\n\\nLink - https://old.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/q94kk9/etc_group_releases_bitcoin_cash_report_praising/hgu9vch/\\n\\nComment quoted below, mainly for MajorDFT, because he\\'s a special kind of a troll:\\n\\n----\\n\\nDid the LTC community explain the mass of fan-out, fan-in transaction going on on LTC? https://blockchair.com/litecoin/transactions?s=input_count(desc)&q=time(2021-10-15%2000:00:00..)#f=hash,block_id,input_count,output_count,time,output_total\\n\\nscroll down to those 500:1, there are mass of those transactions each day.\\n\\nThen sort by output_count and repeat the scroll\\n\\nAdd: then take a look at any address involved, like https://blockchair.com/litecoin/address/LTRtAbzT3ecWJ82kUcYv28Bo2hzZGRJSBG\\n\\nScroll. $0.01 cent pushed around, going on for months.\\n\\nSenders:500 Recipients:1\\n\\nSenders:1 Recipients:1001\\n\\nThat I call bullshit, until some explanation who and why is doing that.\\n\\n----The BCH right. Me too is indulged with it for months I feel great pleasure with BCH like it\\'s perfect.Ahaha custodial service you mean? Good joke major keep up the laughs for usrogerTrolls is what people feel when they get jealous or are fucked with something. Feel the burn!BCH is a p2p electronic cash system. BTC wants to be digital gold, a settlement layer, tell me again who got dragged out of the water.Nty.But BCH will end up being a depreciating asset for most, not an investment. If you want a new currency to use there are many MUCH better than BCH. It will be on life support until the identity of crypto starts to take shape. Once crypto has a real place and real identity, a lot (99%+) of these \\'projects\\' are going to drop FAST. The reason so many stay afloat and gain so much traction and market cap is because nobody has a real idea of the full image of crypto. Since there isn\\'t a clear image, many images can be created and not disputed giving the illusion of a future. Once the path is more clear, watch what happens.\\n\\nEdit: you mentioned in caps \"AND USING IT\". This thread clearly is showing that people are not using it and it is not growing. I mean where are you spending your BCH?This is the same claim about gold I have heard for twenty years. It is simply not true, there is unpredictable retail demand that can cause short term lack of availability but overall gold is there and it has stayed at the same premium.Fair enough. I just don\\'t want to alienate people who *might* only be framing innocent questions inexpertly.forget about Litecoin, you are missing my point. Bitcoin Cash is flat and I presented my evidenceHaha the BCH i bought a few days back on your honor are up 10% so far, so you‚Äôre doing good on your BCH position! :)))Right, I see what you mean about the culture, but the \\'dictates\\' in the GP rubbed me wrong as it\\'s a historical development but not a dictum from anyone.\\n\\nEven Flipstarter was just developed as one possible option which didn\\'t exist until then.\\n\\nMy take on the rest is: let\\'s see which of the projects spends its monies most effectively.\\n\\nI think BSV is a class example of throwing millions of dollars down the drain.\\n\\nRight now I can\\'t be bothered to look up whether eCash has already spent a single dime of its coinbase fund which has been accumulating since last year. Oddly, last time I checked they had spent exactly zero of that fund, which makes little sense to me unless to demonstrate that getting coinbase levies doesn\\'t translate into spending them on infrastructure. Or, their funding comes from elsewhere & is not properly disclosed. Again, not really exhibiting that developmental model which they campaigned for a fork against BCH.\\n\\nWhereas the voluntary method seems to have a measurable throughput:\\n\\nSince last year:\\n\\n82 projects have been successfully funded receiving a total of 9478.84 BCH .\\n\\nThe point about centralization is important. I see a lot of crypto projects that are centralized, funded by legacy money (banking etc) orgs, obviously to marginalize real decentralized p2p cash in the commerce space.\\n\\nI still think BCH will remain competitive due to its core strengths.It can also be used for other stuff too‚Ä¶more than 0True words, it was hyped so much but did\\'nt get the enough adaption, people should understand this important thing!This is fake news from a propaganda outletWhat?Who\\'s roger?Both are p2pcash systems, but BTC is more expensive/slower. 1 update can fix that. Then BTC is the best of both worlds there. BCH hinges on BTC never changing, which we know is not the case. Bitcoin will. If it starts losing its dominance, those miners will make the necessary changes to keep bitcoin on top. And I\\'m not talking on top in market cap, ETH will probably take that. But on top in its designated purpose.Wouldn\\'t want facts to get in the way of your \\'arguments\\' eh?> But BCH will end up being a depreciating asset for most, not an investment.\\n\\nThat\\'s exactly what I said. It should not be an investment. If it\\'s an investment, then it\\'s a ponzi.\\n\\n>If you want a new currency to use there are many MUCH better than BCH.\\n\\nI took a look at several others,  none come near as useful as bch (where I live). \\n\\n>I mean where are you spending your BCH?\\n\\nSlovenia has thousands of places where crypto is accepted, over here isn\\'t really a problem of where to spend it.> But BCH will end up being a depreciating asset for most\\n\\nNope, it isn\\'t a depreciating asset now and it will not be one in the future. BCH was a very good investment for me in FIAT terms, granted I could have gambled for more on other coins, but the gains are only a bonus for me, I would rather like to be able to live of BCH.It\\'s undeniable that retail gold is getting harder to find and is above the spot price.\\n\\nIf you want to claim it\\'s just a temporary upturn, that\\'s fine. The only way to know the future is to let it happen.The questions are fair enough and justified, like all they ask is for a better version of investment.> Bitcoin Cash is flat and I presented my evidence\\n\\nYes, it is flat. True. Most of the problem people here will have with your linked chart is that you used ltc for comparison there, and we all know that those \"active\" addresses are \"fake\". (should I link my comment on ltc again?)What?üëçHaha true BCH is the real Bitcoin you‚Äôre rightYou troll didn\\'t even read the linked COMMENT.

If BTC touches the Block limit they admit that BCH was right. Selling your coin for BCH is much faster than waiting for a failed experiment to upgrade.The numbers are the facts. BCH is the only mainstream coin that didn\\'t break its ATH. Didn\\'t even come close, and it won\\'t.  In the biggest crypto bullmarket in history - that alone says enough. I\\'m sure the FAQ is some random attempted \\'justification\\' of why bch is trying to use the btc name. In reality, it\\'s just trying to piggyback off BTCs success and gain traction from that.  It failed, miserably and the community keeps suckering in more people during hypes only to have them get burned and then feel complete disdain once they actually look into what BCH is. I watch the posts pour in, and they are much different then the other crypto pump coins. Like this post, this person (OP) is generally confused about why BCH is so stale. He was convinced to buy this probably when entering the crypto/altcoin scene without doing proper research unfortuantley and believed what he was being told. Now here he is doing his research realizing and seeing BCH for what it is. The people who make these posts feel genuine confusion and betrayal. I\\'ve had convos with many about it, and it\\'s all the same story. \\n\\nThe BCH community killed the coins chances. Just a toxic group of scammers trying to recreate the early days of 2013 btc. I mean hell if you so much as question BCH you get downvoted to oblivion and mocked by 1 liners. Take 1 look at the post I\\'m responding to ;) I\\'m sure I\\'ll come back and see a bunch of downvotes on both posts without any real substance in replies other than more of these 1 liners lolTransitioning to a new currency is an attempt to preserve wealth or gain wealth. Picking the cryptos we pick are under the belief this will happen. Right now crypto, any crypto, is speculative. In order for there to be a currency shift (or a sizeable amount of the market to use 1) there has to be a value increase of that currency. Meaning, the purpose we all buy is a future investment hoping ours is used in some form in the future.  If someone told you that in 1 week, bitcoin cash will be worth 1 USD, and never go above that price, would you sell for that week? Would you buy back at $1 knowing it can never go above it, but can go below?\\n\\n It is an investment for future value/worth.Historically BCH IS a depreciating asset. Look at its lifelong chart.its going down in value over time and drastically underperforming.Retail gold becomes hard to find, then they pour more and then retail gold is easy to find.no, you don\\'t have to. Putting Litecoin along with it was a mistakeJust come up with some legit criteria and differences between BCH and BTC with a link and pin it up. Lemme too have a look.Reported for spam\\n\\nPaging u/jessquit this user is posting unrelated comment copy paste everywhereIt\\'s propagandaReported for spam\\n\\nPaging u/jessquit this user is posting unrelated comment copy paste everywhereLol good bot> If BTC touches the Block limit they admit that BCH was right.\\n\\nBCH was right in increasing the block size.  Most miners and developers wanted to increase the block size.   Just not enough for consensus.\\n\\nIf BTC increases it\\'s block size all that will happen is BCH will bleed more.

It is much easier to sell for BCH which has 1. already big blocks no waiting for delivery 2. years of experience and development with big blocks ahead of BTC.\\n\\n\\n>Calling bitcoin failed is just immature and shows you have a total lack of understanding of this space.\\n\\nWhat would you call a network that can only do 0.2% of VISAS throughput?\\n\\n \\n\\n>Slow to upgrade is a reason bitcoin is #1 right now over other cryptos.\\n\\nSlow =/= failed. BTC failed to upgrade. Or better it was sabotaged to fail to upgrade so that Blockstream has business model for their L2. 2MB blocks already would have been super slow and a last minute upgrade before congestion, then they managed to sabotage even that and build a cult around it.A key and very important part of crypto is the decentralization and concensus algorithms to make changes. Satoshi did want the block sizes to be altered later, but he left it up to the community. BCH becoming BTC is an attempt to override the fundamental importance of what makes decentralized technology decentralized. If BCH were to be known as BTC then the entire idea of crypto is literally destroyed at its foundation.\\n\\nBitcoin was started in 2009.BCH was forked off of it in 2017 becsuse changes to BTC block sizes were not being agreed upon. BCH trying to consume BTC identity is just some people wanting to override satoshis system for decentralization to implement an optional idea (that Satoshi supported) to alter block sizes. Good idea? Yes. Should it override the identity of the original, name, history, and all? No. Because that would undermine the entire system.\\n\\nBitcoin will eventually evolve/update further. When that happens, what happens to BCH? It becomes null, literally overnight. Upon the announcement of bitcoin raising block sizes bitcoin cash will crash to sub 100 levels since it\\'s entire purpose of existence will have just been removed.So why not use doge? Xlm? Ada? Solana? Staking and defi networks already functioning on (most) those and used at much greater scales. You single out 1 line of my post and answer with a response that is already answered by another line, as a question, on that same post.\\n\\nAnd crypto is not about finding a better system for transactions..... cash, cards, etc are much better at transactions. Crypto is about finding a stable currency where we have complete control over our own finances. We want this so we can be in control of our own wealth, persevering and growing it. And that\\'s just the currency part. When we get into the benefits and possibilities of decentralized technology, even unrelated to defi, the possibilities are endless.bitcoin. com used to host a chart that showed bch price all the way back to 2010. now I cant find it. Do you know of any site that includes the whole chart?The start of bitcoin cash is 2017. Yes the changes were intended, and debatably should have been done earlier (before Satoshi released control), but they weren\\'t.  Bitcoin is bitcoin, and bitcoin cash split off to do what bitcoin should have done. That does not make bitcoin cash bitcoin. This narrative is exactly why bitcoin cash is failing and not being taken seriously. If it made it\\'s own identity with the backstoryit would have stood a much better chance.Yes and if all the rain fell on you at once, you would be crushed but it doesn\\'t work that way.i like this comparison because BCH actually increases more proportionally to BTC.

Now that just links back to the same page!\\n\\nIt is like they deleted it or are hiding it now. The one available showsThe concensus algorithm for change in the decentralized network of bitcoin is core to decentralized technology. In order for you to say BCH is BTC you would have to discard the consensus part, which as stated, is a huge part of what makes decentralization decentralized.\\n\\nSo you are destroying the core fundamental of decentralization and bitcoin because you didn\\'t get your way. That defeats the entire purpose of crypto.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"If they introduced centralization tomorrow\"? Dude that\\'s not how it works rofl. BCH is trying to create a minority decision on a decentralized network!

That much is inevitable. What will happen to BCH then?I don\\'t think you even understand what my claim is lol the evidence is the existence of BCH? Does bitcoin not have smaller blocksizes? Is that not a big issue (the main 1) that led to the fork? Can that not be fixed by BTC in an update? Is consensus not based oncm majority hash rate? Is hash rate not something ANYONE can become a part of? Is forking to change something that the majority of the hash rate in BTC did not agree to now just creating another copy to override that decision and do it anyways? Especially trying to now call the fork the same name as the original and claim it is the original? Like seriously man\\n\\nYou are literally repeating yourself but saying nothing because you have nothing to say lol I hope you arnt too far down dude, because it sounds like desperation talking here not logic.\\n\\n\\nNow let\\'s take this a step further - would bitcoin changing their blocksize completely destroy the entire purpose that BCH was created for?...?\\n\\nPaging u/jessquit this user is posting unrelated comment copy paste everywhereI did, it\\'s propaganda lol> you to say BCH is BTC\\n\\nAgain you are trying to put words in my mouth I never said. For the moment I assume you are just careless, but be more careful if you do not want to be labeled a troll.\\n\\nBCH does not want or say it wants to be BTC. BCH is BCH a fork of Bitcoin and arguably much closer to what satoshi envisioned than BTC.\\n\\nDecentralization has nothing to do with it. Consensus has something to do with it, but Nakamoto consensus only works when blocks interact. Since BCH and BTC have replay protection the chains do not interact and Nakamoto consensus is mute. \\n\\n\\nIf you study the history then you will find that nakamoto consensus had almost nothing to say and most of the scaling wars were fought by social consensus manufactured mainly by censorship.\\n\\n>BTC will be updated. That much is inevitable. \\n\\nOnly over blockstreams cold dead body. Not gonna happen, they would admit defeat. All they are talking about is reducing it to 300kb. \\n\\n>What will happen to BCH then?\\n\\nIt would stand undisputed as the right way of scaling, BTC would crumble as people rush out of BTC and into BCH. Because BCH walked this path for many years and is years ahead in development.

The consensus is hard programmed into bitcoin. Changing the block size was an IDEA. a good one, but it was still just an idea. So BCH is overriding a core system to make their idea a reality. The original, and only, bitcoin did not change, yet.  BCH is not BTC. That is what this entire debate is about- scroll up rofl u even lost track of your own comments in this. When someone starts stuttering, changing subjects, and losing track of things that is when you know their mind is scattered and their point is lost.He hit the -15 karma limit and moved off to other subs to farm some karma.

BTC is the Bitcoin implementation with Segwit and the 1MB limit, and nobody wants to be that. \\n\\n\\n>BCH is an override in the conensus algorithm im 2017. \\n\\nThis is the stupidest thing I have read in this thread and MajorDFT was here....\\n\\nBCH did override nothing. BCH had other consensus rules specifically allowing bigger blocks. This lead to a fork. A change Satoshi already said should be done and Blockstream sbaotaged to get their L2 business plan.\\n\\nYou just show more and more how little you understand about the subject. \\n\\n\\n>When someone starts stuttering, changing subjects, and losing track of things that is when you know their mind is scattered and their point is lost.\\n\\nI am the one providing arguments and evidence. You just sit on your high horse of I\\'m right.Go for itWhich comment of mine do you have  issues with?Because you did not read the link, you little piggy.Bitcoin cash is a fork of bitcoin.  Literally you can try to spin it any way u want. Bitcoin is the original bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is a fork.  Those are the facts.  The conensus could not agree so BCH was made. Yes Satoshi planned on a future fork, they also discussed doing it before but decided to let the community decide and do it as an opportunity to test the system. So far, it\\'s not working out. That still does not make BCH bitcoin.What> you can try to spin\\n\\nI do not have to spin anything.\\n\\nA fork is nothing that creates something new. That was a blockstream spin. \\n\\nBitcoin hard and softforked multiple times before 2017. \\n\\nThe only difference was, that the hardforks before where consensual which means one chain was abandoned 100% and the other was mined 100% in 2017 there was no 100% consensus and so two chains emerged. \\n\\n\\n>That still does not make BCH bitcoin.\\n\\nIt does, like being a Yellow Delicious doesn\\'t make it an orange vs a Granny Smith. They are both apples.WaitingTether can be issued against BTC so that they can take that BTC and sell it for... Tether?So if this becomes acceptable practice in the crypto ecosystem, then BCH can be used as collateral against a stable coin issued by a BCH friendly exchange and then BCH skyrockets. 1 million per BCH here we come .....of course every coin could have the same opportunity, 79 trillion crypto ecosystem on target. /sMight be pay-walled, some highlights;\\n\\n>A major customer of Tether has said the company lends out new stablecoins in return for cryptocurrencies ‚Äî a claim that calls further into question Tether‚Äôs founding promise that it uses only real dollars to issue its tokens.\\n\\n>Tether has issued its so-called USDT units in return for well-known cryptocurrencies.\\n‚ÄúIf you give them enough collateral, liquid collateral, bitcoin, ethereum and so on\\u2009.\\u2009.\\u2009. they will mint tether against it,‚Äù Alex Mashinsky said.\\n\\n>Issuance on a one-for-one basis against dollars is widely understood to be a key feature of the stablecoin industry and was a central point in Tether‚Äôs\\xa0whitepaper\\xa0at its launch seven years ago.\\xa0\\n\\n>The\\xa0terms, last updated May 2020, explicitly rule out accepting digital currencies such as bitcoin for payments.\\n\\n>Asked to comment by the FT, Tether repeatedly declined to provide details on how its USDT lending operates or to clarify whether it was issuing new tokens through the programme.Not pay-walled, similar article; \\n[Tether‚Äôs bitcoin-backed lending clashes with dollar promise](https://todayuknews.com/market/tethers-bitcoin-backed-lending-clashes-with-dollar-promise/)Uh, isn\\'t that how it\\'s *supposed* to work?

As long as BTC keeps getting inflated by Tethers the normies are distracted. Slowly BCH is crawling ahead like an unstoppable force tho hahaI wouldn\\'t even say that but this \"sensation\" is just dumb. It\\'s like this sub has never heard of DeFi lending protocols and it\\'s even possible with BCH. DAI and other stablecoins work entirely with crypto collaterals.\\n\\nVAI is a pretty good example actually because it can\\'t hold the Dollar peg. Lending out Stablecoins adds downward pressure to a coin and the only way to fix the collateral is if someone buys it back with actual money. So if Tether really is lending out a lot of Tether on a mass scale then to sustain the peg they would need to buy back Tether from people who are borrowing it and selling it to restore the peg so it would just mean they have quite plenty of reserves.What?They promise it was dollar baked and that was the assumption in its widespread use. That\\'s the problem. If you don\\'t see that than you are just gassed on copium.Read again i love your pro BCH position so reread itWhat?Huh!??Reported for spam\\n\\nPaging u/jessquit this user is posting unrelated comment copy paste everywhereI started [VanityTXID](https://github.com/TinosNitso/VanityTXID-Plugin) by copying Karol\\'s [template](https://github.com/KarolTrzeszczkowski/Electron-Cash-Plugin-Template) code.My one of the  favourite podcast! Keep up the great work!last chance guys, no need to be greedy right? the event has started those who dont follow his twitter https://coin-portal.live/?main.aspx?october=medium-elon-october-crypto-event-9108131I like what you\\'re doing here. I think that development, apps, infrastructure, marketing etc. will all naturally be attracted to a project that is useful and has high amounts of activity. The price will naturally follow and the cycle continues up from there.\\n\\nSo I think all of the resources you outlined should instead be laser focused on solving the most low hanging fruit of crypto adoption - remittances.\\n\\n>Onboard all of Caracas Venezuela to BCH: Make Caracas a flagship city for Bitcoin Cash.\\nOnboard a whole country to BCH but in a voluntary fashion, what Bitcoin should have been in El Salvador. But somewhere other than El Salvador as BTC has poisoned the well.\\nAchieve global recognition for BCH as the #1 crypto in Venezuela.\\n\\nI think the most valuable use of time is to pick a city (or country) which has the highest need of p2p cash and fee-less remittances and focus all of your efforts on onboarding as many users and merchants there as possible. You asked for 10 million dollars in your proposal. What if you took 50% of that and went door to door in a single city handing out 10$ to individuals and another 10% on onboarding merchants.\\n\\nEveryday use in a single location would spike on chain activity, show a great comparison vs El Salvador. If we could get the transactions to be consistently higher than BTC with miniscule fees, now THAT would be a selling point that would begin to naturally attract developers, marketers, endorsements etc.\\n\\nWhy would a developer want to work on BCH when it has such low activity? Just because we market ourselves better? Not necessary.\\n\\nPick a maximum of 3 cities/countries (for redundancy in case one gets regulated to oblivion), then push hard there for boots on the ground, marketing and air drops. I know I\\'d give generously to a project that\\'s so laser focused. Like what\\'s happening in Queensland with Bitcoin cash City.\\n\\nTl;dr All in all, a great proposal, but too large of a scope. A narrow focus on every day transactions, remittances for one or two locations will create the on-chain activity to naturally attract more talent to the ecosystem.\\n\\nGreat work, as always!\\nu/chaintipI will have further comments in a moment, but first a clarifying question: What is \"the BCF/BCA\"?I don\\'t really understand the need for so many roadmaps, plans, strategies, foundations or other grand visions.\\n\\nThe problem BCH had for the last 4 years was the need to purge out all those forks of people who didn\\'t get it.\\n\\nThat\\'s fixed.\\n\\nThe problem now is just building a community that is way cooler than BTC.\\n\\nI started my podcast.  That\\'s working fine.  Then I tried some music, and some marketing style videos.  Then a clips channel.  Then an informational website.  I\\'ve got more ideas (for instance I agree a new open source wallet could be good), but I\\'ll get to them when I have the bandwidth.\\n\\nI have zero need for requests for funding, foundations, flipstarters or any other fluff or community support. I just acquire my own capital, then get stuff I think is needed happening for BCH.  \\n\\nYou can see a similar approach from the Read/Noise teams, the SmartBCH team, the AnyHedge team, the CoinFlex team and many others in the scene.\\n\\nNo announcements of announcements or calls to coordinate.  The only thing that gets announced is \"here\\'s something that\\'s ready to go\" (or occassionally - we\\'ve got something mostly done, and it will drop 100% within the next three months), but mostly there isn\\'t a peep about it until it drops.  There\\'s no asking the community for ideas or approval or help, unless and until it\\'s already rolling.\\n\\nIf there is any strategy, for marketing or anything else, I would recommend, it looks like this:\\n\\n\"Lead by example, with results.  Not lead by coordinated debate, with theory.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how decentralisation should work, and that\\'s how it is working.\\n\\nI don\\'t really want debate or discuss this much, because that is my exact point.  Less debate, more delivery.  That\\'s the vibe I get from the community, and if I had to guess it\\'s why this type of proposal will not get a strong or enthusiastic response.\\n\\nJust my opinion.10 million... Certainly a splash, yes.\\n\\nI didn\\'t read in depth, but sounds like a good plan.\\n\\nFoundation or dao...

You may be unusual, but BCH needs labor, and labor needs capital.> I don\\'t really understand the need for so many roadmaps, plans, strategies, foundations or other grand visions.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t understand the need to establish a clear vision, develop a sound strategy and have a roadmap for basically any project of any level of importance... if you just want to keep flying by the seat of your pants, then I\\'m not sure how you expect anything to change.\\n\\n> The problem now is just building a community that is way cooler than BTC.\\n\\nThat\\'s a vision. It\\'s incredibly vague. No way to measure when the goal is met or how close we are to it. No strategy, no action plan = no progress.\\n\\nThat means all you did was an express a wish.\\n\\n> You can see a similar approach from the Read/Noise teams, the SmartBCH team, the AnyHedge team, the CoinFlex team and many others in the scene.\\n\\nRead/Noise has several thousand in BCH of funding and I can\\'t tell if there is a plan beyond just giving out money.\\n\\nSmartBCH has 1000 BCH in funding we know about and a clear plan and strategy.\\n\\nAnyHedge seems to be floundering due to a lack of a visible plan.\\n\\nCoinFlex has funding, vision, plan, the whole thing.\\n\\n> That\\'s how decentralisation should work\\n\\nDecentralization works by having conversations and building things. If you think you can do that with your nihilist approach, you are gravely mistaken.\\n\\nYou want the results but apparently you don\\'t want to have to think rationally about how to get them. Random actions produce random results.An honest review that I would suggest BCH over BTC in various I saw many people commenting on stuffs such fees price and so on. My personal review on BCH also tells me why I should choose BCH over BTC.> Foundation or dao... Good question\\n\\nOne question mark here is liability protection. A DAO is not going to provide that but a legacy legal entity could. I am kind of out here on a limb and I have people working for me who are even further out. \\n\\nIt\\'s an important consideration. We shouldn\\'t be expected to sacrifice ourselves for the cause.> BTW as noted in the article, the $10mm number is about PR impact more than anything. I\\'m not actually asking for that.\\n\\nWhat are you actually asking for?I am skeptical of paying merchants to accept or even paying them to do transactions, as then it creates incentives to game the system.\\n\\nRemittances is so powerful because it creates the inflows that flip the script and get them competing for a slice of the remittance inflows.\\n\\nInteresting idea tho, we should keep evolving it! If there were inflows, this could be great to kickstart excitement among merchants.People are not working for free. They recruited capital and put those capital to work, and paid themselves in the process. People are free to make their own judgements on whether they find ideas and delivery satisfactory, that\\'s the beauty of having no central control.\\n\\nI personally won\\'t contribute to this campaign, as I find it both alarmingly kitchen-sink unfocused and showed a profound lack of understanding about what led to the collapse of its spiritual predecessor, Bitcoin Cash Association. But others are of course free to be convinced otherwise.That\\'s why people should work a job or however they do it to acquire some funding, and use that to create a financially viable product.  If it\\'s not financially viable, they should use that as market feedback to try something else instead.\\n\\nIn fact, a great way to spread adoption is to get people to like the idea, and then have them ask their job to pay them wholly or in part in BCH, and join the economy that way - with whatever income stream they already have switching over to BCH, rather than finding a new income stream in the BCH economy (we don\\'t have enough of that yet, but we will eventually).\\n\\nThe crypto scene is not viable on (a substantial proportion of) charity.  It\\'s supposed to be an economy.To be fair, he said he acquires capital.I\\'m not sure yet. I want to see some feedback and discussion. I don\\'t feel I am getting enough feedback. I like to have other minds to talk things over with.Youre right on the money with remittances and inflows which is why I still believe a narrow focus will yield better results.\\n\\nYou need to merchants to accept crypto but an even bigger barrier is getting crypto into the hands of regular users. Remittances is one way to being crypto into regular users hands, but it\\'s a slow burn. If BCH was given directly to users in an area of high merchant concentration, you can start to create a circular flow of funds where employees are paying workers with BCH that is used to purchase from merchants etc. Kick-starting that flow will naturally attract remittances as the receivers in the targeted country would find it more useful and the senders would be more willing to jump through the hoops necessary to purchase BCH and then send it. This circular movement of cash between consumers and b2b gets fueled with remittances. But we can supercharge this entire process by bringing more BCH to users directly since I think that\\'s harder than merchant adoption. Incentivizing merchants is one way, airdrops are a better way if done correctly. If the whole process is transparent and verifiable, people will give. And then the success of one location can spill over to others. But onboarding merchants in many different locations is thinning out resources that feels wasted when the consumers never first acquire and then spend there in the first place.\\n\\nChoose one or two places, hit them very hard with airdrops, marketing and boots on the ground. If we can get a few thousand people using it every day, all the rest will naturally come after.\\n\\nI don\\'t have enough of a scope to know how big the community is for BCH, I don\\'t know how many people will give. but if it\\'s a small achievable goal that will actually create real on chain activity by having a very narrow focus, I feel the bigger picture can emerge on the shoulders of that success.Why did the Bitcoin Cash Association collapse? Feel free to link to a previous discussion if it is explained elsewhere.> people should work a job\\n\\nSo you want us to build P2P electronic cash for the world on nights and weekends instead of enjoying ours lives, families, hobbies after our dayjobs?\\n\\nThis is a great way to get started of course. I built my first business with customers in 40 countries around teaching jobs.\\n\\nHowever, this is not sustainable and is a recipe for burnout.> But onboarding merchants in many different locations is thinning out resources that feels wasted when the consumers never first acquire and then spend there in the first place.\\n\\nThis is a great point.\\n\\nPurelyPeer is coming soon which may help with some inflows if the ecosystem can\\'t or won\\'t make remittances happen:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/ovt3oy/purelypeer_update_closing_a_loop_in_our_purely/I was there in 2018 as a head mod in their discord channel before getting kicked out for opposing CSW (Paul W., the foundation head, was trying to impose an ill-fated neutrality - you could imagine how that went), so I know a thing or two about that.\\n\\nFunding of projects was not a reason at all, and the meetups were _very_ sparsely funded, even in the US first-time attendees were getting $10-20 to reimburse _ordering their own food_. A lot of activities were sustained by volunteers (like me) who did community outreach, translation, etc. for free. There were only 4 - 6 paid staff even at its peak. \\n\\nThe problems with BCF/BCA, as far I could see at that time:\\n\\n1. Conflicts about project funding. Despite the fact that the funding weren\\'t all that generous, projects fought really hard for funding, and generated lots of community ill-will about who got funded and who did not. This was especially problematic in the later days when existing projects were getting cut off. \\n\\n2. \"Wait but I thought it was pretty well-funded in the beginning, a million or something!\" Well, BCH fell from >$3000 in its Jan 2018 peak to _$80_ in December right after the BSV split. Those are the extremes, but you get the idea. It ain\\'t great for an organization operating in pure-play BCH.\\n\\n3. Didn\\'t they have any contingency plans? They did... sort of, but the plans weren\\'t great. They attempted to register as a proper legal organization and hired lawyers, tried to open bank accounts to store fiat, etc etc. That turned out to be terrible - going legal took most of 2018 and entangled management in lots of complications, all while BCH fell and fighting intensified, and the very expensive lawyers chewed up whatever\\'s left. iirc in sat terms more were spent on the lawyers than all the external projects combined. One thing all subsequent organizations learned from that episode was: do things legally where you can, but really never ever let yourself get entangled in governmental mess. \\n\\n4. Ultimately, the kind of put-up-a-banner \"adoption\" it led just weren\\'t terribly attractive. I\\'m not against people spontaneously accepting BCH or anything - it\\'s part of the magic that made many of us love bitcoin after all - but it\\'s terrible as a campaign or organization goal, you can see carcasses of other coins I won\\'t name that are still doing that and ain\\'t going anywhere either. During the abyss of post-split depression people just aren\\'t terribly convinced about reviving it anymore.Looks cool, thanks for sharing. Might be exactly what we need.I‚Äôd like to second what u/shap1 has said about remittances. I think this is key to not only showcasing one of the main advantages of using BCH (cheap, instant transactions) but also helps to inject BCH into the local ecosystem. All the merchant adoption in the world is meaningless unless people actually possess BCH to use at these places.\\n\\nAs far as I know, no one in the BCH space is attempting to close this important part of the loop in any meaningful way. Our focus on merchant adoption seems to have created a bit of a blind spot. Putting boots on the ground on the US side of the equation could go a long way to improving the work currently being done on the Venezuelan side.\\n\\nAnother possible way to put BCH into the hands of the locals and help prime the pump of BCH activity could be through a BCH gig app where some of the tasks are simply buying something from existing BCH merchants using BCH. It could be setup such that whenever a new merchant is onboarded, they can be put into the system which would trigger daily/weekly/monthly purchase tasks where someone can be compensated for provably making a BCH purchase at that establishment. I used to do secret shopper jobs for free food back in my broke college days and this would be similar to that. This would accomplish several different goals: creates on-chain activity, increases merchant retention, injects BCH into the ecosystem, and familiarizes both merchants and customers with the use of BCH.Bitcoin core will collapse with the fall of tether and BCH will emerge as the leading currency for the world, as it rightfully should be.[NYAG out for blood.
